[00:00] - Hey, everybody, welcome, welcome. I guess I'll give folks a few minutes to show up.
[00:09] What is the new name of the stream? It's now OSS Coworking.
[00:12] Okay. - Yeah, I just put it as OSS Coworking with DistributeAid.
[00:19] So that way if people just show up on my channel, then they'll just see that too. I figured it made sense, enough sense, and hopefully people show up to hang out with
[00:30] us today. But like, I feel like that's the cool part though, is like, now that we're doing it as
[00:37] coworking, it's like no pressure. If nobody shows up, like, we're cool.
[00:42] We can hang out with each other. - I think it's that astronauts meme where you're like, no pressure, and I'm like standing
[00:50] behind you like, there never was any pressure. - Okay, yes, for you, for you.
[00:56] For me, I always, I don't know, I put way too much pressure on myself when it comes to streaming.
[01:01] Like I do, but I don't. I don't know.
[01:04] It's weird. It's weird.
[01:06] I feel there's days that I do and there's days that I don't. I'm probably just super like, I don't know, but I'm stoked that today is coworking because
[01:18] I have a lot to catch up on. - Yeah, yeah, no, I think it's good vibes.
[01:22] Like, it always was kind of like a bit of a coworky stream, and so I'm glad we're leaning into that, for sure.
[01:31] - I do think it makes it easier having, where we don't all have to work on the same project at the same time.
[01:38] - Yeah, yeah. I think it's, like I do enjoy pairing up on stuff, but I feel like that can be a bit limiting,
[01:46] but like kind of cowork all together presentation type format, like, yeah, yeah, it's like kind of nice for especially some of the work that you're doing, right?
[01:57] Like with code, it's a bit harder to jump around and to show step-by-step, you know? But I feel like for what you're doing, you know, like talk something through and then
[02:08] be able to like work on it for a little bit and then maybe talk through the updates, like show those off, right?
[02:13] - I haven't really updated the, like I had my call with Jess and then I haven't updated the page since.
[02:21] So I'm really excited just to organize it and be like, "Okay, I now know what I'm doing next."
[02:27] - Yeah, yeah, for sure. No, it's good, and it's an exciting time.
[02:36] So is this going on the YouTube channel? I got the tweet out.
[02:42] I got the tweet out. - Yeah, yeah.
[02:44] It's going on the YouTubes. - Okay.
[02:46] - And it goes on my YouTube. I wasn't sure.
[02:48] - Yeah, no, it's good. I think we got a...
[02:50] We're bad about like adding stuff to our playlist. We might do those updates later.
[02:52] - Yeah. - But yeah, no, just for folks listening from the future, hi, I'm Taylor with DistributeAid.
[03:06] This is the lovely Jen. Congrats on your new job, Jen.
[03:13] That's very exciting. - Thank you.
[03:15] - Yeah. - I'm Jen of Many Trades who does podcasting, live streaming, DevRel, and traffic.
[03:24] - Now you get paid money to do that, right? - Yeah, yeah.
[03:30] - That's awesome. - That's cool.
[03:32] - Yeah. Yeah, no.
[03:34] I want to tell folks about that a little bit. - My official intro, not my just like, "Hi, I'm a spazbot intro."
[03:41] - Yeah, I'm going to meet myself and snack because that's what I'm excited about. The new coworking format, I feel like I can snack on screen.
[03:49] So you let us know and yeah, what's going on? - I will say to start off with, and it's not like this is sponsored, but I just got this
[03:59] grapefruit drink and it's really good. So you were talking about snacking and I really like this drink.
[04:05] - Yeah. - Anyway.
[04:07] - We should get them to sponsor us though. - Yes.
[04:09] Yes, we should. - I like your grapefruit drink.
[04:11] Do you want to send me a pallet? Can you mutual aid me a pallet?
[04:13] - Yes, a whole pallet. - Yeah.
[04:15] - A pallet wouldn't even fit in my garage. - We don't get out of bed for us and a pallet.
[04:19] Come on. Come on.
[04:21] Who do you think you're working with here? - All right.
[04:24] Well, my name is Jen Schnod. I am the host of a podcast called Shit You Don't Want to Talk About.
[04:30] I talk about all the things like literally people do not like talking about to turn it into shit to talk about.
[04:37] Some of the main topics are mental health, neurodiversity, racial biases, homelessness. We have talked about death.
[04:48] We have even talked about shit before and bowel movements. Like literally we talk about a lot of stuff that is hard to talk about.
[04:57] And that created my way of saying I'd love to bus check myself. And by that, I mean that I throw myself under the bus.
[05:06] I will ask questions that people are uncomfortable with or I guess bring it up and continue a conversation because human connection is so important that sometimes it takes us getting
[05:21] out of our comfort zone to ask these questions. And I learned that I love bus checking myself and asking the questions everybody else is
[05:28] curious about. That turned into starting Teach Gen Tech where while I was working on becoming a developer
[05:36] advocate, I started live streaming, learning to code and also just learning all of these very, very technical concepts because I feel like there is learning to code, which is great.
[05:52] But there is also a ton of really technical content that is outside of the code that you have to understand to do the code.
[05:58] And I live stream that four or five times a week now. And one of those streams includes doing things with distribute aid where I volunteer to advise
[06:13] on the DevRel program, which is to be able to create an open source tracks of helping those who have just come out of boot camps to be able to onboard and actually work on
[06:27] real projects and eventually get certifications that they can show to companies that they want to be able to work with.
[06:35] All of that leads up to working with Ivan, who is a database infrastructure company based out of Finland, which is so cool.
[06:45] I now wake up, I'm in Denver, Colorado, and most of my calls start between 4 to 6 AM. >> Wow.
[06:56] I am not a morning person. I would be staying awake until 4 in the morning to make that call.
[07:02] >> No. I'm getting used to it.
[07:04] I think I'm finally getting used to it where I wake up this early, I start my calls and then I end my day with Teach Gen Tech and then I go take a nap.
[07:13] So this is the end of my day and we just launched a database infrastructure series with Teach Gen Tech, or on Teach Gen Tech, however I'm properly supposed to say that, because one
[07:27] of the cool things with starting at Ivan and that I'm very passionate about is being able to make tech accessible, which can be really hard.
[07:38] Because it's giant and scary and so many things to learn. There you go.
[07:43] That is my proper, really long introduction to why I'm chilling here on Distribute Aid and Teach Gen Tech, open source, co-working, and when Taylor is done chewing, please tell
[08:00] us who you are and what Distribute Aid is. >> Thank you.
[08:04] Thank you for giving me an extra 10 seconds, I really wanted to have a handful of nuts. Yeah.
[08:10] Hey, everyone. I'm Taylor.
[08:12] I'm our Director of Growth at Distribute Aid. So loving the new format.
[08:17] It's always nice to get a chance to catch up with my tech besties. And I think Ramon's at a conference this week or something like that.
[08:26] I don't know. It's been a busy spring.
[08:28] >> I feel like we should just start putting a photo of Ramon, like have photos of us for whoever's missing.
[08:34] >> Oh my God. Can we get Ramon queued up to some of the sound cues so we can like do Ramon catch phrases
[08:40] when he's not here? >> That would be so amazing.
[08:42] >> Let's just not even tell him about that. Let's just do it.
[08:46] And like he'll be on screen and we'll like press one of the buttons. >> That would be really funny.
[08:50] Then we can send him the clips afterwards. >> Yeah.
[08:53] It's like the April Fool's Day stream or something like that. I want to check that now.
[08:57] Is April Fool's Day on a Thursday? No.
[09:01] It's Saturday. >> It can be.
[09:03] We'll just stream a few days. >> We'll just stream on Saturday.
[09:08] But yeah. Hello to everyone that just joined.
[09:12] And yeah. NoDistributeAid, we run the world's largest mutual aid supply chain.
[09:18] That's cool. We source and deliver over $15 million of humanitarian aid.
[09:24] We're currently responding to refugee crises globally, but really mainly in Europe, the U.S. and Lebanon is where we operate right now.
[09:35] And also economic development in Lebanon, Russia's war in Ukraine, supporting the Ukrainian, the people of Ukraine, of course.
[09:47] And getting into some disaster response stuff in the U.S. So it's really cool.
[09:53] Yeah. In addition to, like, all the fun supply chain stuff, playing with these big trucks and containers
[09:59] and warehouses, we're building open source technology to really try to democratize, you know, access to knowledge and processes that we've kind of figured out so that anyone can
[10:13] do what we do. Because we need everyone's community involved in taking care of each other as crises continue
[10:19] to unfold in our wonderful future. Yeah.
[10:26] So anyways, just some updates on what's been going on on the supply chain front. We've retooled our route to Greece, which is cool.
[10:36] What up, Feday? How you doing, bud?
[10:38] >> Thank you for joining. >> Yeah.
[10:40] What up? What up?
[10:42] Tell your friends. But yeah.
[10:48] So that's good. We had a bit of a kerfuffle, new round of U.S. sanctions in February, man, new round
[10:55] of compliance stuff, man, we had to, like, change a few things up, but we are now shipping to Ukraine again.
[11:03] I think we're going to do two containers in March. Setting up some new partnerships and things is always fun.
[11:11] What else? Oh, we're about to buy more cooking oil from Ukrainians.
[11:17] This time we're trying to organize a full truck to Greece, and we're going to save, you know, some tens of thousands of dollars for our Greek partners, but also direct, you
[11:26] know, about 100 grand to the Ukrainian economy, which is cool. This kind of builds on our experience doing that, I want to say, in February, sending
[11:35] a few pallets to northern France. So that's fun.
[11:39] I think we picked up one of our partners' orders of 5,000 tents from a manufacturer in China, which is cool, it should be arriving with them soon.
[11:52] Things are going well. I had a fun, our monthly hubs working group for our U.S. hubs was the other week, and
[12:00] that was really cool. We had some friends in L.A. join us for the first time, and all the East Coast folks,
[12:05] you know, were like, kind of set up East Coast warehouses, they're like, hey, we have all this hand sanitizer, we don't know what to do with it, and the L.A. folks are like, oh,
[12:13] yeah, here's how you make, like, a DIY, like, you know, cinder block heater, using hand sanitizer, an old beer can, and a cinder block, or something, and you can give it to your
[12:24] houseless neighbors. And just like, hand sanitizer burns, so burn it, keep people warm.
[12:30] It's always fun to see kind of, like, creative grassroots solutions to these sort of supply chain problems.
[12:36] >> For sure, and that is kind of crazy, and what up, yay, we have more people joining us.
[12:48] And as Taylor says, go tell your friends, please, and thank you. So I would say, like, there were a couple questions that came up for me while you were
[12:59] doing this, and it's so crazy, because I think, when I think, when I think of Taylor, I think super smart, techie person, and then there's also this, like, whole, like, you know, supply
[13:11] chain, distribute aid stuff, that I'm also, like, I'm pretty sure you've told me, like, seven times about this stuff, and I'm just, like, that's a lot to, like, wrap my head
[13:22] around, because it's also really cool, but I don't know anybody else in that field or doing anything.
[13:27] So what goes into a container, like, how, can you help us conceptualize how big one of these containers are, or what might go into them?
[13:37] >> Yeah. I mean, a container is not quite, but approximately the same size as, like, an 18-wheeler, right,
[13:45] like, not the cab side, but if you take the back of the truck, like, that's what I'm talking about when I talk about full trucks, full containers, is, like, a full 40-foot shipping
[13:53] container or 53-foot 18-wheel truck, and, yeah, no, they can store lots of things, usually most of our shipments have 100,000-plus items on there, yeah, and a good example, community
[14:13] collected side, like, for a shipment to Greece, we've just reopened up our UK to Greece route after a few years of dealing with Greek bureaucracy after Brexit.
[14:26] You'll have men's, women's, and children's clothing targeted to the upcoming season. You'll have different hygiene products, so you can imagine a whole variety of basic hygiene
[14:38] products there, soaps, shampoos, razors, you know, sanitary pads, right? You'll have maybe some educational or toys and activities sort of materials, depending
[14:53] on, you know, toys, games, notebooks, pens, pencils, sometimes. What else would go in there?
[15:03] Shelter items, like tents, sleeping bags, so it's a lot of, like, basic survival stuff, right?
[15:09] We kind of look at the globally accepted sphere humanitarian standards and have kind of extended that to add different items that we think people deserve to have as, like, a base level,
[15:20] and to kind of adjust things to the grassroots context, right? We can't provide housing, but we can provide tents, and, you know, a lot of it comes down
[15:29] to, like, what does it take for humans to survive with some measure of dignity, right? So not literally just survive, but, you know, like, have the basics they need to go out
[15:41] and face their life in a refugee camp or in a border, in a squad or something, you know, with enough dignity and decorum to improve their own situation, and that's why we talk
[15:51] about, you know, solidarity, not charity, is we recognize that we can't solve the problem with this aid.
[15:57] We can give people, you know, enough support for them to continue solving their own problems as they deal with the disaster or deal with, you know, the asylum process or something
[16:08] like that. Yeah.
[16:10] >> Because, like, what would be a good way of asking this? Like, y'all, like, have so many donations and, of course, always need more.
[16:24] Is majority of the stuff, when they're shipped somewhere, is it all brand new or, like, let's say clothing, is that used or -- >> Totally.
[16:35] Really depends on the source. So from, like, our in-kind donors program, if you're a large company that wants to donate,
[16:42] you know, a full truck of something, or more recently, over winter break, we sent 20 trucks of lactose-free oatly milk to Ukraine.
[16:51] And so, yeah. >> That's cool.
[16:53] >> Yeah, no, it's, like, you know, it's, like, a couple hundred thousand people getting their dairy needs met for a month.
[17:03] That's going to be new stuff, right? So if it's coming from a company, whether we're buying it or it's a donation, that's
[17:09] all going to be new product. You know, maybe slightly used if we're getting, like, returns, right, but still, like, stuff
[17:16] they might sell, like, a small markdown, you know, on the shop floor. Community collection is a mix of both.
[17:22] We definitely enjoy and encourage community donations, right, secondhand donations. We just launched a new bit on our website, our resources section, which has our first
[17:35] guide, the Assort Guide, which is the community kind of quality control and sorting standards for these used items.
[17:43] So there's definitely a quality control step in there, but I think that's really good. There's a lot of things that we own that we might not wear those clothes again, or we
[17:52] might have moved and not need that set of sheets again, or something like that, you know, and so as long as it's clean and we can sort it appropriately to send it to the
[18:02] right place, then we want to get the value out of that product. Nice.
[18:07] Yeah. And then on the, you know, the community also buys new stuff.
[18:16] This isn't super efficient, but it is very motivating for donors, they want to, like, give people something, right?
[18:22] Of course, we still want you to donate cash, you know, to fund the shipping costs and things like that, but I totally understand, you know, wanting to bring something to the community
[18:34] center and, you know, drop off a handful of canned groceries or hygiene products or new socks and underwear, for example, we wouldn't accept any used underwear or anything like
[18:46] that. Yeah, for sure.
[18:48] Yeah, sometimes those are easier to manage, right, because they're new, right? Sometimes the used stuff is more complicated.
[18:53] On the flip side, sometimes it's harder to manage, because it's a lot of the same type of item, but it might be different brands.
[19:02] So depending on what it is, you know, for example, laptops, those are dangerous goods. So we'll, you know, work with our partners that do educational programs in Lebanon, right?
[19:14] And they'll do big community collection of laptop campaigns, but then they give us a list of like, you know, 200 different makes and models of different laptops, and we got
[19:21] to go hunt down the individual material safety data sheet, you know, for that particular brand of laptop.
[19:29] Yeah, so like, sometimes we just tell people like, No, don't don't do that through community collection, it's not going to be worth it, or, you know, it's better to, and that's why
[19:38] we have these different strategies, right? And that's why, you know, we want to make some use data, we want some new stuff, it
[19:43] depends on the item, which one's more efficient to get, which one is, you know, appropriate or not appropriate.
[19:50] Yeah. And Aaron is blowing up our chat with, there's a high, also, yes, about the the laptops.
[20:03] And Aaron, don't apologize, it makes me happy. Yeah.
[20:07] I'm about to invite you up onto the stream to chat with us. Yeah, you want to?
[20:12] You are more than welcome, Aaron, like we are, this is a co working time. Yeah, co working time, chit chat.
[20:17] We got snacks now. We can snack.
[20:19] Yeah, come join. Hold on.
[20:21] Hold on. Because I can't like process right now, I'm going to DM it to you on Twitter, just so
[20:38] you know where I'm DMing it, because there's too many things going on. I'm not a background music, y'all.
[20:59] Okay, I sent it. Yay.
[21:05] Yay. I'm excited.
[21:07] Aaron's awesome. Yeah.
[21:09] No, definitely. Welcome to the co-work, Aaron.
[21:11] And you're definitely like, welcome to just hang out on stream and co-work, it'd be nice to like chit chat for a minute and then, yeah, I think we all gotta, there she is.
[21:21] What up? What up, Aaron?
[21:23] Hi, guys. Hey.
[21:25] Sparkly. Or like shiny, your jacket.
[21:30] Thanks. So because Aaron and I talked about makeup last time, we were on a conference together.
[21:40] I can't really say we were, I mean, we were kind of streaming. You're kind of streaming.
[21:45] When you're conferencing. Yeah.
[21:47] We were talking about makeup and okay, so I love Zmoll, I think it's what it's called, where you buy glasses and they had an ad on Facebook where I was like, cool, I do want
[21:58] those glasses maybe someday, but I need that lipstick that the person was wearing. I was really admiring that and then like, I have this, it's like covered in dog slubber
[22:08] right now because I stole it from my dog, so let me wipe the dog slubber. This is like, we're going to keep the makeup trend going.
[22:16] I have like four cubes of lipstick and three things of nail polish on my desk. Nice.
[22:21] This is this brand I bought because I got TikTok influenced by this account called the Lipstick Lesbians.
[22:26] They're lesbians that are lipstick, makeup chemists and beauty founders. What?
[22:31] That's cool. They're like the greatest.
[22:33] And there's, they're scientific though. They're like, talk about the ingredients and how it like changes, how it appears on your
[22:37] face and like why different ingredients work on different face types. TikTok account, top 10, but their lipstick is also really great and they talked about
[22:45] like the different, like what they chose to invest in that is higher quality and what they chose not to invest in.
[22:50] Like when you get lipstick, sometimes they have like a, a like logo impressed on the actual stick of lipstick and that's expensive, but they have a, this one has like a magnetic
[23:01] clasp that is still expensive, but it is cheaper than impressing your logo on the lipstick, but it still provides the feeling of luxury things I learned on TikTok.
[23:10] That's cool. That are completely not related to the talk I'm supposed to be working on.
[23:13] Yeah. Y'all are going to like get me to redo these nails by the end of the stream.
[23:17] Do it. Do it.
[23:19] Do it. Maybe in a minute.
[23:21] I'm still snacking. My urge for food is, of the lipstick that I took the screenshot of lol, lol really quick.
[23:31] I'm gonna, Aaron, I adore this, but, and Taylor, like we derailed the conversation, but I feel like this is one of the fun things about, I was like Taylor, I was really enjoying that
[23:45] cause I was actually like learning about a lot of difficulties cause I did work somewhere with coworkers in Benin where it's like really hard to get laptops there.
[23:55] And I did not realize that this was like things that took months, literal months. And I was like, just put a laptop in the mail and like insurance and cover it good.
[24:02] That's what I love about like software folks are like, Oh yeah, continuous delivery. I just hit a button and it goes global and like all our ed servers, I'm like, you know,
[24:12] like it might show up in three months or it might show up in four months and we'll get it there.
[24:17] I can guarantee you that. But like, I was a hardware product manager for two months, Taylor, and then I quit that
[24:25] job. The person who hired me was like, this is talk about jobs that were not a fit.
[24:31] I worked somewhere, I had three titles in eight months. It was not great.
[24:34] It was a job I quit. One of those experiences.
[24:36] But anywho, they were like, yeah, software product manager and hardware product management aren't that different.
[24:41] Right? No, that sounds totally different.
[24:45] I was like, I have no idea what I'm doing in this thing. And I like would look at things and they'd send me like specs of like CAD files and I
[24:54] was like, I can open them. That's a file.
[24:56] I can forward it to someone like this is going to be like, call an engineer and be like, tell me what this means.
[25:02] Okay. Side note.
[25:04] Yeah. Side note.
[25:06] I love the lips by the way, Jen, I'm just like, why color is this? Fuchsia.
[25:11] No, no, I know that color. I know that color.
[25:16] That color is trouble. Let me tell you.
[25:18] That color is like, it was nice talking to you after the first date and I'm going to leave you well enough alone.
[25:24] If you're aware. I do think I have a lipstick this color.
[25:26] It is the, hold on. It is in the, that's a.
[25:28] Cause I used to have this bright of a bright pink, like, first off, I'm going to see if they have a dupe in the freaking Fem Power Beauty.
[25:41] Okay. Cause I mean, I can bring it back up, but we were talking about more serious things
[25:46] than makeup. And I think that I need to go find the, the lipstick lesbians is what you call them.
[25:58] Are they? It's their, their TikTok is legit.
[26:00] The lipstick lesbians. Okay.
[26:02] Okay. Cause I know that.
[26:04] And they're like super, super great. They also have a pin.
[26:06] They sell a pin that says boss ass bitch. I do it on that as well.
[26:12] Here's the, the, Oh, I, where did my window that has the, sorry, I'm like swearing today. No, that's cool.
[26:21] Fuck it. I'm a logistician.
[26:23] So, you know, if, if we're making this more of like a cowork, I'm just going to be myself and curse words are allowed.
[26:34] The only thing that I would say that I don't know how to turn off spam. So if you see a spam in the chats, please ignore it, but I just linked the, the lipstick
[26:53] lesbians in the chat to all of our channels in case anybody would like to look it up. There's their products and like, this is here, I'll even demo, I don't even know how to be
[27:06] a beauty YouTuber. This is going to be my attempt.
[27:08] Everybody, I'm going to pretend to set the stage. This is some power beauty.
[27:12] This is the color Eve. I bought it as part of a boss bitch pack that came with a pin and I was influenced and it
[27:18] came with a red and a pink and I really like hot pink lipstick. So this is the pink.
[27:22] I'm going to put it on, but I put lip gloss on, put it on anyway, it's probably going to look crap.
[27:26] It's so bright. I'm actually going to take more than, I'm sorry, not to cut you off, Aaron, go for it.
[27:36] No, no. I was just going to say, I thought, I thought the lipstick would take longer, but you're
[27:40] pro. But usually I'm like dabbing a lot.
[27:42] I'm like trying to clean it up, you know anyways, no, Jen, you're saying earlier, we were talking about more serious things.
[27:48] Let me make beauty and makeup serious for a second. One of the biggest issues that we see in these refugee camp environments is boredom, right?
[27:57] People have very little agency in their own lives, you know, unfortunately, the way that governments run these camps, like doesn't allow for people to take care of themselves
[28:05] in a real sense, you know, as NGOs and the government kind of doing a lot of things for you, right?
[28:12] Like serving you meals instead of letting you cook for your family. So I always loved seeing my different, you know, like site visits and stuff like that,
[28:24] the kind of wellness programs that folks set up and one of the really fun ones, I of course couldn't see it directly myself, but some of my female colleagues got to participate
[28:35] in, in like beauty classes and stuff like that. It was just like a bunch of like teenage, like Middle Eastern, North African girls hanging
[28:43] out, you know, at some like mid 20s, like European chicks, and they got, you know, some donated beauty products and everyone was like doing their hair and their nails and like
[28:54] it was like a fun way to spend the afternoon and create a safe environment to chit chat, right?
[29:00] That's so cool. Yeah.
[29:02] So it's literally like everything that we use in our day to day lives, right, like is something that could potentially be helpful if you got someone running the right program
[29:10] out there, which leads me to something that I do a lot, Erin, I'm always pitching. So if Fem Power Beauty ever wants to donate a palette or more beauty products, or maybe
[29:22] do a partnership, you know, you'd be like a Tom Shoes, like buy one, and we'll gift one to a refugee or something like that, right?
[29:30] Got it. I'm not affiliated with them.
[29:32] I'm just a purchaser. No, I know.
[29:34] I should do that. I'm gonna, I'm influenced.
[29:36] Yes, there we go. I've been influenced because I really want to buy this set and I don't know her name.
[29:45] I hate it when I don't know somebody's name and I follow them on TikTok or like whatever social media and I'm like, I can tell you all about their content.
[29:54] Don't remember their name. It's really awkward because she lives in Brooklyn too and like I missed her by three hours at
[30:00] the Credo store. And then I was like, oh shit.
[30:02] And then I was like, what if I did run into her and I was like, what I'd like, this human, this human is on TikTok and I follow her on TikTok and I don't know her name, but it's
[30:17] a really pretty pink. And I think this is the pink I want to get.
[30:20] So there you guys go. I have found a, that is something I watch a lot on TikTok too is how brands don't color
[30:32] shade correctly. They say that they go super dark and they don't.
[30:36] It's lies. Yeah.
[30:38] Yeah. Then you would love the lipstick lesbians account.
[30:41] Like that's a great account for this stuff. Yes.
[30:44] Okay. Cause they do a lot of that kind of stuff.
[30:46] And she's like, this is bullshit. And let's talk about like the problems and like all of these are owned by like the same
[30:50] three people. Call them out, call them out.
[30:53] Yay. So what we were talking about was just like more of like the background of distributed
[31:06] and what they do. Oh, did I do that?
[31:08] Oops. Rude.
[31:10] My bad. We're just going to have to stop and restart this right here.
[31:15] We're just going to do it over the YouTube recording, you know? Yeah.
[31:21] Yeah. So what I love about coworking is that's kind of just how it rolls, you know, like, is like,
[31:27] there is a huge difference between like coworking and trying to showcase something. Yeah.
[31:32] Where co-working is just kind of like fun, you know? Now I know you had things you wanted to work on Taylor.
[31:42] Did you want to show us that or we want to work on, Oh, Hey Erin, I'm working on making a open source onboarding tracks.
[31:57] Wow. Because I wanted to tell you, I just completely blanked what I was trying to tell you.
[32:02] Okay. I love this.
[32:04] Can I jump in for just a second? Yeah.
[32:07] That sounds like a great way to kind of move us towards the more practical side of the coworking.
[32:12] Maybe if Erin would be so kind, you could show, like tell Erin about the dev champions program and show her your work and kind of where you're at with it as a way to just catch
[32:24] yourself up as well. And then, you know, switch the coworking that would give me about 10 minutes here to set
[32:29] up the, uh, the get pod and kind of get ready on the coding side. And then when you're ready, I can kind of switch in for the, uh.
[32:37] Yeah. And I can get kicked off whenever I want.
[32:39] I just tuned in because I saw Jen was live and I was like, it's like my, my excuse for body doubling.
[32:46] Yeah. That's kind of what we're doing.
[32:49] I was like, I just need someone to like, hold me accountable cause I'm supposed to be working on a talk and that's me.
[32:55] Yeah. Well, if you're, if you're happy to give Jen 10 minutes here and just give her a chance
[32:59] to kind of walk you talk about it. Yep.
[33:03] Yeah. Right.
[33:05] I will. I will share the screen.
[33:07] I'm going to be right back. It's more copy and I get this good pod going.
[33:11] So this is the part of, this is from like, um, over a month ago, which is kind of funny, uh, we're working on building different tracks.
[33:22] Not that zoomed in bro. Like medium zoom, medium zoom of like, uh, different tracks that people can join after
[33:30] they go through a bootcamp where like it will give them tasks to do to help them go from like a bootcamp to project management or design or content or front end or visualization.
[33:45] And eventually we will have it where it'll be like, everybody has the same, like first four weeks of like, it's the same thing every single time.
[33:56] So everybody's on a level playing ground and then whatever is going on at Distribute Aid will be their second eight weeks to help walk them through it and also give back to Distribute
[34:06] Aid. So the goal at the very end is to give them a certificate that shows that they did this,
[34:12] they, um, worked with us and that they are more hireable. Yeah.
[34:19] And it's like real work experience, which is the most important part. Like it's something they can turn around and showcase, which I like.
[34:25] And I like the focus on like project management because I think we don't talk about that enough and like how much of project management is like wrangling people across like all different
[34:33] functions. Yes.
[34:35] And it's crazy to me that people don't talk enough about, um, that it's literally hurting cats.
[34:42] It is. There's no joke about that.
[34:45] It is. And so my next goal, wow, did you like say, stay put, is to build out one of these as
[34:54] the test one and get that ready to roll out before we build out the rest of the tracks and organize this not organized and make it pretty.
[35:09] So it's readable if anybody wants to look at it and, oh yeah, uh, good question. It is, we're calling it currently like developer champions program or actually impactful developers.
[35:24] Or if you think about like Microsoft MVPs and stuff like that kind of stuff, it definitely is.
[35:33] Uh, I'm working on building it out so we can launch it and you can join us. Like I'm curious, and this is a big part of it is like finding out which track we should
[35:44] start with. I'm thinking more front end because it's visible and could have a higher impact on being able
[35:54] to get more people interested in it long term. But I mean, I'm slightly biased because I learned front end first and like I'm like
[36:07] a scary, scary, like just now I'm feeling, starting to feel comfortable in a terminal. Um, look out, my Docker skills gotten tough, talk to me about containers, but only kind
[36:15] of slightly because sometimes they break and I don't know how to fix them. So I cry a little and then I'd go back to see what I did a little, but like I started
[36:23] in front end and it's like, in my brain it's like, that's the easier way and more intuitive way to start.
[36:28] But like, I also recognize that I'm not everybody. I get that.
[36:33] I get that. I think it's definitely something where it would, I don't know, I feel like I'm that
[36:41] way too, but I don't know if it's the way the industry is or just, I found a lot of people like me that went to front end first.
[36:52] And I think that like, there's some challenges to just to get there in some context, our main project we'd start people off with as our landing site.
[37:00] So we don't really have a backend, right. We're using Gatsby as like a static site generator.
[37:04] Um, and there's like the backend side of that, which would be ingesting and processing data on the Gatsby side, right.
[37:12] Where you do have to connect to other APIs, you know, do some like data processing, dump it into Gatsby's GraphQL side, right.
[37:21] So there is like a backend or kind of a middle end side here, but we're, we don't have like a full on backend.
[37:27] Um, yeah. So Jen, are you talking like when you say front end, you know, are you looking at like
[37:37] the landing sites full stack, or are you talking about more of like the front end UI kind of implementation side of that?
[37:43] Right. I would say more of the UI just, and that's where I'm a little stuck because when we talked
[37:51] to Jess, it totally made sense of just doing a, um, like starting with one track first, but then also how do you make it something comfortable that like a project manager or
[38:06] somebody else could use. And that's why I'm thinking also front end, like the UI, because that is something that
[38:14] as a project manager in the past, it is very annoying to have to wait for everybody when I'm like, y'all, we need this done.
[38:23] It's a simple fix. I already have access.
[38:26] I'm just going to go fix it. Yeah.
[38:30] Um, which to me, it's like those when you're working with nonprofits or growing companies or startups, you kind of have to have that, like know how to do that kind of stuff.
[38:43] And it, I feel like it's a bit more universal than, you know, trying to talk about project management, which is kind of helpful, but if you're just somebody that just wants to
[38:56] be told what to do and not have to think about the overall picture, I don't know if that would really help.
[39:01] Yeah. Yeah.
[39:03] For sure. Like the project manager might need to be like more involved.
[39:05] The code can be a bit more directed. Um, yeah, that's interesting.
[39:11] What I might recommend is like, so maybe tracks was initially the wrong concept, especially if you want to do like one track.
[39:19] Right. And what I'm seeing here is that like, we also need to balance capacity.
[39:25] We can't have like 10 people all contribute to the UI side of the front ends because we're not going to be able to create enough issues.
[39:33] Everybody wants a different color, but it was more like, uh, I'm thinking for the first four weeks of like showing them how, um, it's done.
[39:47] Everything's done in with code C and, you know, doing the PR and kind of stuff. And if we have the same default area, that's something that they can do.
[39:57] And then maybe the next four weeks we specialize because I really like that model. Um, because I was about to say it was like, like maybe it's not tracks, but it's more
[40:09] of like merit badges or something, you know, like the scouts, right. And you can do different, you can kind of upgrade your merit badge.
[40:17] Right. So you can do the same thing, but like, you get better and better at archery or whatever.
[40:21] Right. Or you can get a whole variety of different ones.
[40:24] It's a bit more choose your own adventure. And I feel like that's a scalable thing of like, if we do these kind of four week, you
[40:32] know, so let's say let's call it a tour, right? You want to do an open source tour, you know, yeah.
[40:39] Skill tree, right. Like love that, you know, that that's where I'm getting a lot of this inspiration from
[40:43] is like, you know, there's, there's a different kind of skill tree and open source development than in commercial development.
[40:49] Um, yeah. So let's like maybe call it a tour and everyone has to start with the same first four weeks,
[40:57] which is how to contribute to open source at distributing, right. Give them that same background, like you were talking about, make sure everyone's on the
[41:05] same page there. And then they can choose different areas of the code base to walk through.
[41:11] So if you wanted to do like a UI area, right, versus like, maybe one of these more Gatsby data processing things, then that means that we can kind of stand those up, you know.
[41:25] Oh, that's where I went. Yeah.
[41:31] Yeah. This is Miro or is this another tool?
[41:37] It's another tool. It's Lucidcharts.
[41:39] Oh, I haven't. You know what's funny, Jen, is that Nicole just signed up for Miro because she saw someone
[41:46] else using Miro. I love Miro compared to Lucidcharts.
[41:50] Do you want to switch to Miro? I would rather switch because it's like, Miro has it where like, I can like scroll
[42:01] out forever. Ever.
[42:03] Yeah. Here.
[42:05] Actually, I have, if you guys want to see, I can share. I've got a Miro board up actually right now.
[42:07] I say that and then I currently lost my Miro board. That's funny.
[42:12] Wait, I got it. Yes.
[42:14] It has my sticky notes all over it, ignore my, I mean, it's not very far of thinking, so this is my thing I'm working on.
[42:30] I'm giving a talk at PyData Berlin and it's my first talk with code. Wow.
[42:36] So I've done talks before, but I haven't done like talks being like, this has code in it. Wait, do I have to show the screen?
[42:44] Oh, there we go. And so this is Miro, but I mean, so far this is just like, I mean, my proposal has already
[42:51] been accepted, but I was like, here, I'm structuring it and I was like, here's my intro, open source landscape.
[42:57] Here's how I'm going to structure it. Here's the process.
[42:59] And this is the part I'm scared about. Cause there's going to be a brief demo right here and then here's a conclusion.
[43:04] And then I was like, how have other people to show the zoomie effect? Hold on.
[43:08] Nice. I see chat GPT, so I'm going to add, suggest you add a box there, which is just ethics
[43:16] of whatever chat GPT thing you're talking about. Yeah.
[43:20] So exactly. So the talk I'm giving on is on reinforcement learning for large language models and large
[43:25] data models. So it's like, Hey, big models.
[43:27] Like when you bring large models, you get internet size biases. And so here's a way to effectively train and retrain at a lower cost models.
[43:37] Wow. So it's like, yeah.
[43:42] And so, but like, I was like, here's how do people show the processes before? Because this is like three days of computing power.
[43:47] So like, I'm not going to go up there and do that. And then like, here's a bunch of other ways that people have done it.
[43:51] And then so far, this is the Aaron brain, but yeah, you can like scroll up for everybody. Yeah.
[43:59] Because like, you can use different parts. Yeah.
[44:04] You can share different parts. Exactly.
[44:07] So if I only want someone to see a certain part of it, I can, and, but it's still all together because that's where my brain goes.
[44:19] Yeah. Like I sent this and it's got like notebooks.
[44:21] And this reminds me of like a little bit more like Figma or something. It's more like we use both where I work, where it's like, depending on like what team you're
[44:31] coordinating with. But yes, if a Miro is an option, I would love to switch over to Slack, Nicole.
[44:42] Okay. That reminds me.
[44:44] It reminds me to add a Slack on this account to my computer, but yes, I'm agreed with you on Taylor.
[44:53] I'm actually have a blog post coming out soon on chat GPT four or GPT four. It's no longer just chat because they have computer vision in it, but it's actually like,
[45:08] it's interesting, but also not like, it's, it's, I have more, like, I'm interested more in like the open source aspects of it.
[45:14] And like, that's the part that I find more scary is like the fact that like so much of our machine learning and our data and our research we've done out in the open, especially
[45:22] in the world of like machine learning. And like I should have forewarned, I like work in machine learning and like I'm in the
[45:26] data side of it. So it's like, Hey, the philosophy of like where I work is like good data makes good
[45:31] produced ethics. You know, if you have good data, you get better models stuff.
[45:35] And it's like, if these tools, I personally believe like we're not running away, like models and machine learning isn't going away.
[45:42] No, you can't put the genie back into the bottle, right? Yeah.
[45:45] You can't put the genie back into the bottle, but it's also been around since like the 1970s, like computing and human, human computer interaction has been around since we started connecting
[45:53] computers together. Like that's essentially the core of it.
[45:58] And so it's just like, but so much of it has come from academia that they've built in the open, which is really cool and exciting.
[46:06] And now it's scary as a lot of these companies are like, no competitive advantage covering it up.
[46:10] And that's like, I'm like, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
[46:12] Well, I mean, we see that happen a lot, right. Where there is a lot that comes out of, you know, like the internet, right.
[46:16] It really came out of government funded research, you know, like military stuff, like, exactly. And then like very quickly, there's this like capitalization phase, which like commodifies
[46:30] these things for the masses, which makes them more accessible, which in some ways is good, but is also like very commercially driven and very closed, right.
[46:40] You see the same thing with pharmaceuticals or like the government pays for all this research, you know, essentially fronting like the risk, you know, associated with a lot of these at
[46:48] the university level, and then it gets commercialized and people can't afford, you know, like insulin, right.
[46:55] Yeah. Yeah.
[46:57] That's why I'm all the open source to get to the man. Yeah.
[47:01] Yeah. Stick it to the man.
[47:03] I just, yeah, that's what I'm an information wants to be free kind of pirate sort of vibes. Yeah.
[47:10] Yeah. Yeah.
[47:12] Yeah. Yeah.
[47:14] Yeah. Yeah.
[47:16] It's I'm really interested in. So it's like, I'm all talking about like, yeah, these things aren't bad, but we just use these
[47:19] as tools for model retraining and whatnot. Yeah, for sure.
[47:22] No, it's interesting. I think I'm the same Altman with open AI, which is like, you should just take the open
[47:29] out now somehow is charity turned into like, a for profit, and they're not releasing the training data anymore, and all this stuff, I'm just like, yeah.
[47:40] Yeah. I'm glad that like, this is coming about now, because everyone's like a ring or whatever,
[47:49] you know, IoT device that's been getting hacked and spying on them and collecting data for the past, like 10 years, you can now we can now train.
[47:57] And, um, have you ever read that there's a book, um, surveillance capitalism, as Susana Zuboff, if you ever like, want to really hate your phone and throw it out the window?
[48:08] I'm a logistician. I'm not that smart.
[48:11] I don't read books. That's one that you like read, and you're like, I'm gonna throw it out the window, and
[48:16] you're like, I hate my life. And I'm gonna go live off the grid in a mountain for three weeks.
[48:19] Yeah, I love that. It was interesting in Belgrade, there was a point during the pandemic where they installed
[48:25] a bunch of Chinese spy tech, like there's definitely a big, like Chinese kind of commercial influence in Belgrade.
[48:32] And so suddenly, they were like, they already had these like, parking enforcement cars, a bunch of cameras on them that would just scan the road and like automatically issue
[48:41] parking tickets, essentially, they found violations. Like they'd scan the license plate, you know, just drive around the block once an hour and
[48:48] ticket everybody that was like, late moving a car. But they did it with cameras, like very blatant camera sets, I'm sure like cell phones and
[48:57] stuff were connecting to the Wi Fi there, like the cell tower on that sort of camera tower.
[49:02] Yeah, it's interesting, like seeing the surveillance capitalism side in the US, but then like, the more authoritarian surveillance, but like using the same tools like distributed network
[49:14] of ring doorbells versus like, state installed, you know, kind of camera thing almost looks like an angel.
[49:22] You know, the biblical drawings of angels with all the eyes all over them. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49:27] That's what we're doing. We're like recreating like these monstrous angels with a bunch of cameras just staring
[49:32] at us. This is Jesus again.
[49:34] Yeah. Cringy.
[49:36] This is cringe. Okay, my trackpad died, I went to go do that.
[49:43] And now we're talking about angels and swallowing tech. And okay, well, ending.
[49:53] Yeah. And usually with me, it goes to the world's ending at some point in the conversation.
[49:58] I mean, I just kind of assume the world's gonna be dead for a while. That's kind of my thing.
[50:01] I don't know. I've got hope, right?
[50:03] Like, I want to know, like, which way it's gonna go in my lifetime. But my retirement plan is to run the toy warehouse at the refugee camp at the end of the world.
[50:15] It's like, I'm gonna be everyone's friend. Just remember me when it all goes south.
[50:21] I'll bring nail polish. There we go.
[50:23] I'm not trading nail polish for teddy bears. Perfect.
[50:26] Perfect. Perfect.
[50:28] I'll bring lipstick. Great.
[50:30] I'm in. I'll trade.
[50:32] Who's got glitter? Yes.
[50:34] We could have a whole tea party. We could have a tea party.
[50:36] Yeah. Okay, great.
[50:38] End of the world tea party plans. Cool.
[50:40] But I did hit up Nicole to get access to Miro. And I feel like that is gonna be a lot easier to, like, get this going because I forgot
[50:53] there was this already a second page. Because it doesn't by default show up that there's a second page.
[51:02] Like I, it doesn't show up at the bottom. I mostly just make, like, charts to present in those tools.
[51:12] Yeah. Um, I don't even know how to get back to it now that I got it.
[51:19] But did we get you? Bye, Aaron.
[51:22] Bye. I love you all.
[51:24] Actually talk about, I'm gonna go work on my talk about reinforcement learning of large language models.
[51:29] You're in Germany in April. Yep.
[51:32] If you feel like swinging by Belgrade, you're welcome to hang out with our European team. Will do.
[51:39] Will do. Bye.
[51:42] Bye. All right.
[51:44] That was fun. Yeah.
[51:46] I was really needed your time wise to get set up and everything. No, I'm just there just give me one sec to make sure I pushed all the code and like the
[51:57] branch I was working on. And then I can share my screen and do some live cutting.
[52:03] Okay. Because I was just gonna say like, uh, there are, I don't know how I'm gonna do this.
[52:10] I still need to learn how to do like multiple pages. I am a very visual person, where like, if I can't see it, it doesn't exist.
[52:23] That's fair. And I did not know that there was enough more pages on here until I made a new page.
[52:30] And I don't know how to get back. I just want to see it.
[52:40] Oh, okay, that's what it means. I mean, I can share what I'm doing right now until you're ready.
[52:50] Yeah. Yeah.
[52:52] If I could just get three more minutes. I there's like some unfinished changes, I just need to push up and move over.
[52:57] It's me trying to figure out how to go back and find all of the pages. That's okay.
[53:09] No, no. What the hell is it?
[53:22] No, Eddie, no, where did these pages go? One of them was important.
[53:34] What is it doing? It's like twitching out over here.
[53:36] Look at this. I don't know.
[53:38] I feel you're both frustrating each other right now. It's like, I don't know.
[53:40] What do you want to do? Oh.
[53:42] Page count. Oh, there's so many pages.
[53:44] Okay, how do I see my other pages? Okay, I'm sharing my screen now.
[54:20] You can switch to me whenever you're ready. Yay.
[54:28] Cool. Hey, everybody.
[54:30] I can't see the chat is the only thing, Jen. Cool.
[54:35] So today, y'all, I'm working on some stuff for our generic pages. Yeah, that's gonna be pages like our needs, like the overview of our needs Explorer, things
[54:59] like this. So it's kind of different content blocks that our admin ops folks can create in the content
[55:06] management system and get them to show up on a page right now. It's just titles and text.
[55:09] That's a bit boring, working on adding images. And yeah, I want to get this is a great way to get a lot of content out the door for us
[55:19] without having to like a hard code a bunch of pages. So that's where we're at.
[55:26] I'm catching up because it's been a few weeks since I've had a chance to work on this PR. Yeah.
[55:37] So where were we at? Let's see.
[55:41] I just want to kill the default stuff here. Okay.
[55:51] What was the branch called feature 972 right and that is going to be these issues just get these pages across the finish line we can look at maybe the our story page question
[56:19] mark yep yep and that just needs this image stuff and then this page is good. So we'll use this as our example issue everyone see by the way let me I'm going to bump this
[56:40] up one and let me know if I need to bump up this the font size anymore. So far it's looking good to me.
[56:47] Everyone please let us know if we need to bump it up even further but so far so good. I will say as I'm drinking this lovely sparkling grapefruit water don't this is something I
[57:09] forgot about and everybody who streams or does video please remember do not drink sparkling water while you're streaming or about to stream or do audio it makes you burp.
[57:23] So if I keep muting myself excuse me I mean sparkling water is gross so I just avoid it anyways it's not a problem oh yeah no I'm gonna like ask for tap water in a European
[57:36] restaurant kind of guy oh my gosh I love sparkling water makes me so happy. I think it's because I like the taste of the minerals in the water don't know if that's
[57:53] healthy or not but hey yeah maybe it also could be uh my first time in Peru I uh thought it meant like no spark sparkling and I got with sparkles oh yeah I think it's just like
[58:14] I hated it back then and then like it was the only water I had to drink so I got used to it and I think it like forced me to start liking it I don't know yeah yeah I've definitely
[58:28] done that with some some foods I'm trying to think of one now maybe tomatoes like salads and stuff okay okay it's not like like whole tomatoes you know but I think I'm over that
[58:45] oh I need to mark this as a work in progress love that uh draft yeah there we go draft PR.
[58:55] I will say that something that will not work to be able to like force myself to get into is mushrooms it ain't gonna happen what type of mushrooms are we talking about here how
[59:11] casual is the uh the hangout any I've had them from all over the world so many different types so like no it's the texture it's the smell it's everything about it I love mushrooms
[59:28] man I can't do it I love tomatoes can eat tomatoes all day there you go I do not like I hate the smell of mushrooms mushrooms are one of those things that like people like
[59:42] or don't like I feel like like you're no one's neutral on mushrooms you know I yeah I've noticed that nobody's neutral on mushrooms yeah but it's weird because I like a lot of
[59:53] earthy things uh all right uh I don't know how to say your name properly I don't think I've ever asked is it hey I did not spell out right excuse my dog in the background
[60:11] if you can hear her how do I say their name Taylor how would you say I'm trying to catch up oh that's a cesium cesium t cesium mt oh yeah yeah it's like um didn't the Russians
[60:28] use that as a poisoning method on someone or something oh my well mushrooms are a struggle for them too but their roommate is slowly uh acclimating them to them because she puts
[60:46] it in everything and her cooking's amazing yeah enough well that's like a good way to get acclimated wow we have so many more viewers now and I I will have to say that I do need
[61:00] to step away and take the dog outside because she needs to go see the vet she has a UTI so be back shortly I gotta take her out okay well I'll keep it running I'm live coding
[61:13] for all our viewers we're working on this uh kind of content block for an image with a caption and right now I have broken our dev server so that's fun um yeah try to get
[61:27] caught up on what I'm doing it looks like date uploaded does not match expected type okay and that is a nice looking time stamp right there do we have to convert it to a
[61:48] date or something what is going on so we're gonna look in Gatsby what we're trying to do right now is uh correctly process uh this information from our content management system
[61:59] and expose it through the Gatsby GraphQL API yeah so content blocks get that going here sweet and we're looking for our image block okay we see this date uploaded as a date
[62:30] that was it okay date uploaded get date property it says does not match expected type so that makes me think get date property here I wrote a little helper
[62:54] little generic helper um so this is if we get an object which is any right from our data source like uh markdown uh header metadata um we can uh kind of coerce it into a type
[63:07] or throw an error during build um which lets us take advantage of our TypeScript um properties yeah so here I'm saying if it's an instance of date right um and I think what we want
[63:21] to do here is basically say oh if it's a string then return it as a date right here it's just like if it's an instance of date then go ahead and yeah this says get date property that's
[63:40] passing in this uh validation thing it's just a get property call so let's go look at get property so this says if it's unknown or undefined okay yeah so if it's undefined if it doesn't
[64:06] have a thing or if it does not match the expected type right and then it's going to return the so what can we do here we don't necessarily want it to throw okay so I think what we need
[64:26] to do here it's like an instance of date and we're passing that in object property huh yeah um that's cool so but we want to do a conversion step here right so maybe what we
[64:57] can do is like get string property if it's being passed in as a date that's cool we basically don't want this to throw we want it I guess we could catch that I'm just going
[65:17] to hack this together for now and if people actually pass in like a date as an object which doesn't make sense for our sourcing that's okay I hope y'all are enjoying this
[65:26] oh no I've lost three streamers three viewers what up we got some info on cesium uh it's like the uh the water yeah probably not used as a poison it explodes that's what it was
[65:41] a very exploity one I like that cool okay so here we want to uh import it spring sweep and that's what we want to do we want to get a spring property from uh
[66:16] we can pass in oh there and then if that succeeds our date spring there and then uh date equals new date and then I feel like with javascript
[67:02] new date there's gonna be like some nan sort of thing right like not a date hello hello I look like a cool kid wearing my sunglasses inside but the glasses with
[67:34] transition nice did you uh see damn it I walked away right after I heard their name and then um cesium t cesium t thank you yeah did you see their comment that it's the european
[67:57] spelling of the element yeah yeah okay okay that was cool I walked away before that so I wanted to make sure yeah yay
[68:15] I would say um one thing I'm excited that we are changing it to this new format is being able to like at least keep being aware of the work even if it's not being deep dived
[68:30] into at the moment yeah what do you mean by that like um as I was saying like for the uh pages out of sight out of mind I do that with work too it's not my favorite like notes
[68:48] I have to actually be able to look at the note pages to remember things whereas if I take digital notes I always forget yeah yeah I gotcha that's that's interesting and yeah
[69:05] like this is kind of gives you a chance to bring it to the forefront once a week yeah exactly yeah cool
[69:30] like what originally got you to start streaming live on da stuff um I was talking to ramon about da and um our my buddy uh maxime who's volunteering with us um since covid
[69:51] uh just joined uh code c at the time and ramon was working at code c and uh we're like hey yeah let's like use this as a way to just get together once a week kind of like we just
[70:00] talked about you know and work on the open source stuff and uh started doing that you know just to get the time in with those folks um or I guess like like we're we started doing
[70:12] that um to get the time in and then maxine joined code c and uh they ended up sponsoring the stream so it's been a good way to uh you know like just kind of check in on a semi
[70:24] regular basis work in the open and uh yeah it's always been kind of co-worky vibes so we're leaning more into that direction now um and we're very grateful for for code c
[70:35] uh contributing you know like financially to sponsor our work that's really cool and code c is is it's definitely something I've learned a lot since y'all started streaming
[70:46] yeah yeah no it's um I think it's a really useful tool in the right context um I wish I got more dev time in because I feel like I'd get more out of code c as well um but
[70:58] there's some cool things we can do and that might be a good you know I hear you on like you're talking about the project manager stuff earlier um you know and like maybe like it's
[71:07] gonna be too difficult to do like a project management task but there we could definitely do like a code based maintainer task or it's like you know hey can you make like code c
[71:17] maps and let's do like a a code smell map right and like track which files have different things that we could improve upon you know things like that um yeah yeah or like kind
[71:34] of set up other things um I don't know there's there's a lot of cool stuff they have this feature called like automations right so when people like submit a pr submit an issue it
[71:46] can like automatically like create checklist items for the reviewer things like that that I feel like you know if we if we got someone to sit down and spend some time with it we
[71:54] could get more out of it so yeah uh oh man I just got really tired all of a sudden well I mean we only had like 15 minutes left on our stream as it is so um I mean let me try
[72:12] to fix this bug and then I might finish the commit and call it I know that I have a meeting coming up okay no do we need to hop off now then um soon but not right this stuff in okay
[72:26] it was a good like you have five ten more minutes and then uh yeah okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay
