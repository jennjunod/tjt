[00:00] Hello, hello, beautiful humans. Welcome to another episode of Misc Monday.
[00:07] Yay! Yay!
[00:09] And we have whatever side of the screen she's on. I never know which side you're on.
[00:15] And we are thinking about going to Makeup and Markdown. Markdown and Makeup?
[00:24] Makeup and Markdown? Like changing our name from Miscellaneous Mondays to Makeup Markdown or something like
[00:31] that. Markdown Makeup?
[00:33] Makeup Markdown? I don't know.
[00:35] I don't know. There's so many options out there.
[00:40] Maybe it should be like we keep Miscellaneous Mondays and Makeup and Markdown is like a segment.
[00:47] Like a recurring segment. That's an option too.
[00:56] I like that. I like that.
[00:58] There's options. Mm-hmm.
[01:00] And I feel like if we do that, we should convince Erin to come on the show. Definitely.
[01:06] And do it with us too because she's been a part of it whether or not she knows it or not on all of these conversations.
[01:14] So yes. And hello.
[01:16] Hi. And for all of those tuning in, well we just hang out because it's Monday and Mondays are
[01:26] kind of a struggle for a lot of us and I just want to let everybody know that I had to do my lipstick today because Laura did her lipstick today and we have the same lipstick color
[01:39] which is like my favorite. So I was like, "Dude, I got to do it."
[01:43] Yeah. Yeah.
[01:45] It turned out we had the same red. And actually I've been thinking about trying, I used to have Russian red.
[01:51] So this is Ruby Woo by MAC and I used to have Russian red which is like a little bit bluer than Ruby Woo.
[02:04] And I'm kind of thinking of trying that out too again because I used to really love it. I think that's kind of cool.
[02:12] That's actually something that I've been talking to my hairdresser about because I'm going to go get my hair done in like two weeks.
[02:20] I'm so excited. I have a job.
[02:22] I can go get my hair done and not just dye it myself. And the dangers of the bleach.
[02:28] It's going to be great that they were, we talked a lot about the undertones of the red or the pink or the blue on what undertones are.
[02:42] But it's crazy to me, and this is one of the big reasons I'm excited about talking about, you know, if we do makeup and markdown because although a lot of people are like makeup is
[02:53] completely separate, color theory isn't. That's true.
[02:58] Yeah. And color theory goes into you have to understand how contrast they are or how much they will
[03:05] work together or being able to understand it and going in and changing. I think I'm thinking a lot about this because of recently working with a lot of CFS and
[03:15] having to understand what colors I like there. Yeah.
[03:19] They all go together for me. Nice.
[03:23] Yeah. Yeah.
[03:25] I don't know if it does for anybody else, but it does for me. Yeah.
[03:31] And another side totally random thing for you is my hairdresser told me she has exotic birds and I don't know if everybody else knew this, but you cannot move exotic birds across
[03:45] state many times without a lot of things to jump through because that makes sense avian flu.
[03:51] Sure. And Laura does not have pet birds.
[03:56] Those are outside her window at her house at the park. But every time we stream, I'm always like, it sounds like you have pet birds.
[04:05] Yeah. Yeah.
[04:07] They're good out there. I don't actually like birds in general.
[04:14] I like non-birds like penguins and ducks. Those are two very not particularly bird-like birds to my mind.
[04:27] And yeah, but I don't like, well, okay, Canada geese are okay. But like the white geese are terrifying.
[04:37] One of them tried to murder me when I was like three. Oh God.
[04:42] And then when I was 12, we got an ostrich tried to attack us and I'm just like, you know what?
[04:51] Fuck birds. They're not your thing.
[04:54] No. Or I'm not theirs or something because.
[04:58] I try to make friends with a lot of them. It does not work in my favor majority of the time, but I am also a, I get in trouble for
[05:15] a lot of things. Like if I go to a museum and there's art that looks very touchable, I really, really want
[05:24] to touch it or really want to make friends with this animal. It's definitely, you know, I've had to learn to just kind of avoid things and look from
[05:37] a far or hope that the animal will let me touch it and not die. And also know that you're not supposed to touch animals and try to convince myself not
[05:47] to when I see the very pretty animal. But I've actually wanted pet birds before, it's been a while, but like they're just really
[05:58] cute. I had a coworker that I used to house it for and they had an African gray, which is a parrot
[06:06] and her name was Katala and Katala, Katala was wicked smart and she could do voices. And in particular, she could do your voice.
[06:24] And so at three o'clock in the morning, she would do the answering machine, pitch perfect. This was back in the days when like answering machines used to talk to you and you could
[06:36] hear the message that someone was leaving. And so she would do the outgoing answering machine message, pitch perfect.
[06:42] You wouldn't know whether it was the bird or the machine because they were identical in sound.
[06:49] And then she would start leaving a message as you, and she spoke in complete sentences as you.
[06:59] "Hi, it's Laura, I'm just calling to find out what time we're leaving on Saturday. Call me back.
[07:07] Bye." Oh my gosh.
[07:09] That is so crazy. Yeah.
[07:11] I mean, she knew like what words went with the answering machine. So she couldn't, she wasn't like, you know, chat GPT exactly, except, you know, what's
[07:21] funny is that the famous paper about large language models, it's called Stochastic Parrots on the dangers of stochastic parrots.
[07:32] And that's exactly correct because she was a stochastic parrot. I feel like that would be the type of pet I would want.
[07:45] There is a very scary owl that was like on a, it lived on a hotel grounds. And of course I meet the owl and I'm like, dude, I want to be friends.
[07:59] I do like an owl actually. That is a third exception to my bird rule.
[08:03] And so basically anytime I see somebody that is like a wildlife expert and has a, I'm going to try to just show it instead of, let's see, I always try to get them to let me pet it.
[08:17] And I got to pet this one. I was very excited.
[08:22] Yes. And hawks.
[08:24] And I just, I, I like have lots of photos of me trying to, yeah, like I really should just like make an Instagram post of the animals I've tried to pet.
[08:40] And I haven't died yet, but yeah. Your story is much cooler about a parrot that, you know, is the answering machine.
[08:52] Yeah. It's so weird too because like I had never left a voicemail.
[09:00] Like so it's not like she was doing my voice, leaving a message that she had ever heard because it did not happen.
[09:07] She was doing my voice because she had learned my voice because we were house sitting. And so we were there.
[09:13] So she learned my voice and then she applied those words with my voice. Weird.
[09:21] Yeah. Yeah.
[09:23] It really was. She also did the fire alarm.
[09:29] And so you're like having to get up and be like, "Is it the real one?" Oh no, it's the fucking bird.
[09:36] So where I work now, Ivan, it's the, the crabs, I have a sticker, very cute. Oh.
[09:44] Is that going the right direction? There we go.
[09:46] So cute. But it makes me want to get pet crabs.
[09:49] I know. I don't know if they want to be pets.
[09:58] I don't know. I don't know.
[10:00] I'm still working on getting a cat. We have our dog.
[10:04] I'm still working on getting a cat. So maybe, maybe one day I'll get there.
[10:10] We'll broaden away from just the dog. But we actually did have something not completely miscellaneous today, even though we're really
[10:21] good at miscellaneous. It's true.
[10:24] I've got so many more weird pet stories. If you would like to go down that route, I'm so down.
[10:29] That's okay. We can, we can keep them for future, future times.
[10:34] Pets. Strange pets will come up again, I'm sure.
[10:38] Are you excited to hear some really random, in the middle of the night, woke me up ideas for talk titles?
[10:48] Totally. I'm just going to read them in no judgment.
[10:51] I'm just going to read them. Live learning is life saving.
[11:00] How learning live unlocks the gate to talk. I'm a potato, ideas to use your neurodiversity to your advantage.
[11:11] Socializing causes me to 404. Debug in your sleep, how naps are your most undervalued, the undervalued tool.
[11:24] Breaking through I don't wanna, how analysis paralysis keeps us from success. Persons in tech aren't here to steal your job.
[11:36] How to ask better questions and get help from those who don't want to help you. Why does tech gatekeep and how to become secure while helping others.
[11:50] The pros and cons of saying fuck it. This one like was cracking me up.
[11:54] It's from Friday's stream because I learned about duck coding. I've never heard of it before, but it's duck coding.
[12:02] And types of ducks and how having data types can help your ducking code. It was cracking me up because it was the opposite of like TypeScript because it's, yeah, anyway.
[12:20] How saying I don't know out loud can help your career. Being secure in your role to use your privilege to level the playing field.
[12:31] They don't bite unless you're a beginner. Overcoming the shame of saying I don't know, debugging dyslexia.
[12:41] Those are so good, Jen. Your middle of the night brain is really good at this.
[12:45] Middle of the night brain, came up with some topic ideas and yeah, that is what I got. I liked what you mentioned about, going back to it because I don't remember what conference
[13:00] it was, DevRelCon London. Yeah.
[13:05] I want to give some context to some expressions that I think my face was making while you were reading because I think at one point I was cracking up and I want to just make
[13:14] sure that nobody thinks that I was like laughing at like your titles as such. What I was laughing at is that like four of your five, so like 20% of yours are blog posts,
[13:30] like stub drafts that I have like started. Nice.
[13:34] Yes. Yes.
[13:36] I like it. I like it.
[13:38] Yeah. Well, there you go.
[13:42] You have some talk ideas. I guess I just hadn't been thinking of them as talk ideas.
[13:46] I was thinking of them as blog posts, but it doesn't have to be mutually exclusive. I think that is a great question because I know that like Ramon and Rizal, which I should
[13:59] go find their deets, do a lot of work on like CFP work, so does Francesco. These are all humans that do a lot in helping others develop their talks.
[14:16] I don't think I've ever asked them, so I'm curious, what's the difference between making something a blog or a talk?
[14:31] I think that it's not at all unusual to write a blog post first and then create a talk from that blog post.
[14:39] Yeah. Okay.
[14:41] I think that's pretty common. I think it also may just be like this is something you and I have talked about, and to answer
[14:51] your question, an idea that I was thinking about for you was how to... I'm trying to think of the title I thought of, because this was over the weekend.
[15:11] It wasn't last night when I was writing down the rest of them, damn it. But about the tech writing can be sexy because being able to be successful is sexy, and like
[15:34] without tech writers, I mean, you can have super ADHD people like me that will make a lot of video, like a shit ton of video, but if nobody transcribes it or does their own
[15:46] work or tries to take it and go do something else, it's not ever going to... You can't search things that don't have transcripts or art in text.
[15:58] Mm-hmm. Too true.
[16:01] And therefore, tech wouldn't be where we're at without tech writers. Mm-hmm.
[16:09] And it's not as hard as I personally thought it was. I mean, it's not easy.
[16:16] It's still not my favorite thing. You can have it all day, every day, all yours, but you made it not as scary.
[16:24] Oh, good. Yeah.
[16:27] And it's tricky because my first job in tech, my first post-academic job was as a technical writer.
[16:40] But in between when I started applying for technical writer roles and when I landed one, I had found out about what developer advocates do and realized like, oh, I think that's probably
[16:57] where I want to end up for a while, not just tech writing. Because developer advocates can do tech writing, but I wanted to do more other stuff too.
[17:12] And so it's slightly tricky because I've just two months ago become a developer advocate instead of a technical writer.
[17:22] And so I'm slightly nervous about pigeonholing myself. If I did a talk as talking about technical writing, would that drag me back to technical
[17:38] writing exclusively as opposed to DevRel as a whole? I hear that.
[17:47] And I-- Mm-hmm.
[17:49] Yes. I mean, like, no matter what role you're in, everyone has to like lean into their skill
[18:00] sets. Mm-hmm.
[18:02] And not like-- and it could be technical-- your technical writing, like if you were to do something like this, it could be about blogs.
[18:09] And there are at least all of the DevRels that I work with at Ivan, they all have to blog too.
[18:22] Mm-hmm. I'm having to review a technical thing, and I'm just like, this is not fun.
[18:28] It is fun, but it's not fun. But it's like-- Mm-hmm.
[18:31] --it's really hard. Mm-hmm.
[18:33] And it's a lot of-- I don't think people are necessarily taught to do it. Like, for example, people are like, Jen, you could write-- or you could, like, do a speech
[18:45] about podcasting or livestreaming. I'm like, why would I do that?
[18:47] They're like, 'cause it's really hard. I'm like, no, no, no.
[18:49] Everybody could do it. It'll be good.
[18:51] Let's go. Mm-hmm.
[18:53] Where it's just something I kind of fell into, so it's easier for me, but it's something that I could talk about, even though I don't necessarily want to just say I'm a podcaster.
[19:05] Like, I'm more than that. Right.
[19:08] Where-- but it is a skillset I have that I could help break it down for others, so-- Mm-hmm.
[19:14] Mm-hmm. But it is another reason why I got hired, was to livestream.
[19:20] Right. But I get what you're saying, because it's almost like typecasting.
[19:25] Yeah, I guess. And I guess, like, I feel like if I-- I could do a talk, maybe.
[19:37] I don't know. I just don't want it to be like I am a technical writer, because I don't want to stay there.
[19:46] I want to stay there. How tech writing got you into DevRel.
[19:50] Mm-hmm. Yeah.
[19:52] Yeah. So that's been sort of a tricky thing, like, while I've been thinking about-- so the context
[20:00] for everybody is that DevRelCon London will be in September, and the call for proposals for talks closes on March 31st, oh, which is 11 days from now.
[20:13] Okay. And I would like to submit a proposal, but I've been having trouble thinking of what
[20:21] to submit, and, like, I have these blog post ideas and so on, but most of them are not DevRel-specific.
[20:27] They don't have to be. So-- well, but I think they'll be more likely to be chosen if they are.
[20:37] So let me go to their website, because they have, like, themes. Ooh, yes.
[20:42] Tell us the themes. For this year-- or for September's con.
[20:48] Yay, Bakari! Hey, Bakari!
[20:54] Yay! Okay, I-- Bakari, have you told everybody the news about the thing you bought?
[21:03] I have not heard the news. I'm really excited for it.
[21:07] That's why I want to talk about it, but I don't know if you told everybody. Yay!
[21:18] It's fucking gorgeous, too. I saw the Zillow!
[21:27] I saw the Zillow! Yay!
[21:29] Congratulations! I want to see the Zillow.
[21:34] Not on the stream, obviously, but-- It's really pretty. I'm very excited for them.
[21:42] Yay! That's so cool.
[21:44] Nice! Um, can I go off on a very random tangent that has something to do with this?
[21:52] It is Miscellaneous Mondays. Okay, cool.
[21:54] Thank you. I appreciate it.
[21:56] Because I do want to go back to DevRelCon, but I really want to share something that reminds me of Bakari's-- a bit of Bakari's story.
[22:04] So yesterday, my friend and I go out for sushi. Y'all, this is, like, a really crazy thing, being able to go out for lunch with your friends
[22:14] after not having a job for forever. It's like, "Wow, I can do this stuff now."
[22:20] This is crazy. So I am very stubborn, and I'm like, "I'm going to ride the bus down there to go meet
[22:25] her, because it's $3 compared to $30." And so I ride the bus down there.
[22:33] All is good. We meet for sushi.
[22:35] We're walking back to her car, because she's going to drive us to the next spot. And we walk by this-- somebody's selling bouquets of flowers, where they're just like, "Hey,
[22:49] donate to the American Lung Association for whatever, and we'll give you a bouquet of flowers."
[22:55] I'm like, "Cool." So we both did.
[22:57] Really pretty flowers. And we get to our next area, which is called the Milk Market in Denver.
[23:03] It's really cool. Everybody should check it out.
[23:06] And I'm like, "You know what? I'm just going to carry my flowers with me, because I'm going to take the bus home.
[23:12] She's going to leave hers in her car, so I'm just randomly carrying these flowers around." And we go, and as soon as we come in, we see the most gorgeous drag queens.
[23:22] And they start talking to me, and they're like, "Oh, are those flowers for us?" And I'm like, "Yeah, take them."
[23:26] And they're like, "No." I'm like, "No, really.
[23:28] You can take them." And they're like, "No."
[23:30] I'm like, "Well, will you take them if we take a selfie?" And they're like, "We'll just take a selfie with you."
[23:38] And I'm like, "Okay, yay." So Denae and I took selfies with them.
[23:43] And then we go to a coffee shop, and the coffee shop has a pink cup, and Denae's favorite color is pink, and today is her birthday.
[23:54] And so we're there yesterday, and they're like, "Yo, we can't give you the pink cup. Those are for us to use, blah, blah, blah.
[23:59] We only sell the yellow ones." And like, Denae super bombs and walks away, and I walk up to them, and I'm like, "Y'all,
[24:05] can I buy the pink cup, or a drink with the pink cup, and you could say I broke it, and like charge me for it?
[24:14] Like I need that pink cup in my life. It is my friend's birthday tomorrow.
[24:18] Pink is her favorite color." And they totally did.
[24:20] They're like, "Just buy a yellow one. We'll just give you the pink.
[24:22] It's fine." I'm like, "Yes."
[24:24] And I'm like, "I'm also asking them, 'Hey, do you have anything I can put these flowers in?'"
[24:30] And they're like, "No." And I'm like, "Okay."
[24:32] You know, I tried. So we go to the bar.
[24:34] There's a bar, like a full bar. And we're like, I'm like, "Oh, if we go to the full bar, they probably have a bottle
[24:37] I could have to put the flowers in." No.
[24:41] Hard no. Any ideas I was coming up with for the bartender, he was like shutting everything down.
[24:46] No matter what. Like he was trying to be nice about it, but not like really interested.
[24:48] He's like, "You guys are just dumb. Like go away."
[24:50] Seats were uncomfortable. We didn't get another round.
[24:52] So we're like, "Oh, hey, we found somewhere else to walk to." And we go into this little brewery and this girl is like, "Oh my God, those flowers are
[25:02] gorgeous. It's my mom's, I don't know, birthday, or she was having a bad day or something.
[25:07] She's like, purple is her favorite color. I need to go get those."
[25:10] And it's two totally different parts of Denver. And I was just like, "Here, here you go."
[25:16] And it was just like crazy. And I mentioned all of this because it's like, all of this happened for a reason.
[25:23] We couldn't find glasses and things because they were meant to go to this bartender, because literally they have the perfect jar to put her flowers in for her mom.
[25:36] And she wasn't going to have time to get flowers for her mom and she really, really wanted to.
[25:40] And I say all of that because Bakari got a house and I feel like shit happens for a reason. And that is like really odd, full circle way of saying I'm super stoked for Bakari.
[25:52] And happy birthday, Denae. Yes.
[25:55] Happy birthday, Denae. Yeah.
[25:58] So thank you for letting me go on my random tangent. I appreciate it.
[26:02] Of course. Okay.
[26:04] Devrel Khan. Okay.
[26:06] Let me... Yay.
[26:08] You're still here. I wasn't sure if you were still here for the full story or not.
[26:13] I don't know if it made sense how there's a, I don't know. So we got scenes.
[26:23] Devrel Khan, London, Bain, developer education, doing more with less, and developer success. Okay.
[26:33] So where do... Are any of those scenes like vibrant more?
[26:42] For me, probably the developer education, just because, hi, you know. As a quick recap, Laura used to be a math professor.
[26:52] Oh, Laura, I don't know if you refer this stream. This is why I literally can't like lie to anybody because I don't remember where anybody
[27:02] is. So instead people just hear things multiple times in a row, or I forget to tell people
[27:07] that. Is Laura, and Bakari, and Lucia, and Anthony are all previous teachers or professors.
[27:22] I'm trying to think if I have any more than that. I wonder how many past educators I could have on the stream.
[27:32] I mean, Ramon is totally an educator. He's not like a...
[27:41] I agree. But he teaches like boot camps and stuff like with tens of thousands of learners.
[27:48] So we're up to six, because Ian, you made me think of Ian when you said Ramon. That doesn't make any sense, but you said boot camps.
[27:57] Okay, so we're up six. So thank you, Bakari.
[28:05] But, Bakari, are you going to submit for DevRelCon London? Because that would be fun.
[28:14] That would be fun, mm-hmm. Do any of those themes speak to you, Jen?
[28:23] Bakari, if you submit, is it something that you can see if they will pay for it? Because I know some conferences do.
[28:36] And you know, sometimes employers. Yeah.
[28:41] That's a tricky thing about like applying for conferences is you might go through all this work and get accepted, but they don't help pay for anything.
[28:49] And they don't always tell you up front, which is annoying, but I can reach out to them. I've done some work for them before, so I can reach out and see if I can find out.
[29:06] But on the ticket page, or on the submission page, they do say that, "Please note, you or your employer will need to cover your costs to attend the conference, but of course you
[29:21] won't have to buy a ticket." And it's in London.
[29:35] Mm-hmm. Yep.
[29:37] Well, okay. It may not work out, but there's other conferences, too, and to answer your question on themes,
[29:47] I would say doing more with less because I am the laziest shit and my brain thinks, "What is the easiest way to get from A to B?"
[30:07] Now, what my brain comes up with is not always that, but it's my thought process at the beginning. Mm-hmm.
[30:17] So I like doing more with less because I think that's the great thing about streaming is literally, I think Theo is a great example of this.
[30:29] I don't know if y'all have ever watched Theo's streams. He is definitely, I can't say he's not everybody's cup of tea.
[30:41] He is not everybody's cup of tea. I find him absolutely hilarious and very, very direct and Theo on his stream will do
[31:01] live stream his short videos while he's live streaming. Mm-hmm.
[31:06] So he has a shortcut that he'll click and it goes in the chat and he'll be like, "Yo," and this is Theo Rantz, he does a Theo Rantz, and I feel like we should be like, "I'll
[31:18] click this for Theo Rantz," and like this, and set up is not like that, but okay. And then he ends the clip and so he recorded his short stuff in his long form and takes
[31:31] care of both, that is doing more with less. Mm-hmm.
[31:38] Totally. I thought it was really cool.
[31:41] I don't know why it was so mind blowing to me, but that's just one example of them of more with less.
[31:48] I also like the idea, what is one that you always tell me about from, Jason Langendorff? Langsdorff, I think.
[31:59] Yeah. Yeah.
[32:01] You are correct. Why I can...
[32:04] Jason's been on the show and I still can't get his name right. I am...
[32:12] I will share Jason's, learn with Jason. And yes, everybody, I do share Twitters.
[32:29] You do not have to have a Twitter to actually look at stuff and you can still see all of their links to go elsewhere.
[32:39] But I think you said it was called the buffalo stick? Yeah, using all of the buff...
[32:48] Using all of the buffalo and like, don't forget the buffalo stick. It's like a combination of idioms.
[33:05] I feel like I'm talking more than I'm used to. I'm not used to talking anymore apparently.
[33:10] This is what happens when, well, I don't really, okay, maybe I do talk a lot, but also normally just potato for the weekend.
[33:22] Yeah, same. And I didn't potato this weekend.
[33:26] This weekend was very busy. It was lovely, but it was busy.
[33:30] But I think this is one thing that I have to realize is just because I can go out doesn't mean I have to go out and it's okay to still potato.
[33:40] Definitely. And I got the term still potato from Ramon.
[33:47] I'm going to go potato. Yes.
[33:52] And let's see, I think I can do shout outs for all these people that we... We should shout out Bakari because Bakari's here.
[34:04] Shout out to Bakari and shout out Arizona, no, oh, it's Ben! We'll shout out Ben because Ben's here, so I can't.
[34:19] Oh, I have to wait a minute, 46 seconds before giving another shout out. So please stand by.
[34:25] Okay. I'll wait.
[34:27] I will wait. And so what other topics, like when you're talking about developer education, I am still
[34:43] vibing like the tech writing, maybe not that phrasing, like maybe it's something about writing in general, maybe not tech writing.
[34:50] Like when I say this, maybe not a technical writer, but educating people on how to create technical content because developer education, you taught me, Laura, you taught me how to
[35:06] learn better, especially when I get stuck and how to work through it. I did it on my own the other day without you there.
[35:18] Yeah. Yeah.
[35:20] It was not my favorite and I may or may not have had a complete breakdown about accessibility tools and felt like I was in high school again, cried a ton, and then decided to walk away.
[35:43] And then the next day I went back to it and just used a different tool and was able to do my first read through of a technical document for my tech review.
[35:54] Oh, good. Yeah.
[35:57] Yep. Yeah.
[35:59] Well, I mean, Ben, I said both, so yes. It was not pretty, but old Jen would be like, "I can't do it."
[36:13] Not because I think I can't do it, but I don't necessarily see how to get through it, where now I'm like, "Okay, even if I don't understand it, I can still go through it, go through
[36:27] the process, highlight words I don't understand, and then go back and research the topics and things."
[36:37] I still need to go back and research, but because you've been on my stream so much, I have learned that it is, I am someone that gets a lot of understanding by context.
[36:49] So I read, listened to the entire article, and then went back through and did the words I didn't understand, or topics, or things I didn't understand.
[37:02] So that way I was like, "Cool, I'm not getting it because of context, so this is something I should probably go research."
[37:08] And I just want to say, you helped me get unstuck with that. Oh, good.
[37:15] I'm so glad. You taught me how to learn better.
[37:19] Yeah. You know, there's a book that I read when I was a professor called Teaching Students
[37:26] How to Learn. And so that could be like teaching developers how to learn.
[37:33] Ooh, yes. I think that would be huge.
[37:39] I could totally do a talk on that. Oh, another thing is, let me find a link for it, but there are lots of blog posts with
[37:56] tips for how to read research papers, which would also be applicable to, I mean, a lot of it would still be applicable to how to read, I don't know what kind of, what the
[38:08] format was for the technical article that you were reading, but a lot of that would still apply.
[38:18] Let me find one of those links. I think that is a big part of what we're talking about, though, is you just, like, taking apart
[38:29] what you just said, there are a lot of blog articles that say this. Yeah, I know.
[38:39] If somebody hands me a blog, I'm going to be like, "Do I gotta?" I will if I gotta.
[38:44] I will use my Texas speech if I gotta, but it's not going to sink in as much. Do you have a video or a podcast or a talk or anything other than an actual blog or tech
[39:01] or, like, docs, because even to this day, I still skip over things that I don't realize I skip over in docs, and my D&D crew gets annoyed at me for doing so because I like
[39:16] to break a lot of things, and then I ask Jacob very nicely to walk me through where I missed something.
[39:23] Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
[39:25] So, yeah. I just want to bring up Ben's question, so would I recommend that book?
[39:36] It's hard to say. It was quite a few years.
[39:39] It was, like, five years ago that I read it, and a lot of it mostly only applies to teaching in, like, a formal academic context because there's, like, teaching students how to read
[40:03] and absorb and refer back to the syllabus, and this is how to prepare for a midterm, and this is how to, you know, and so it was really good.
[40:21] It was really pretty good for that purpose, and in particular, just, like, thinking of okay, so the biggest thing that I got out of that book was just almost the title in
[40:35] the sense that it just recognizes and honors that we do have to teach students how to learn, and, like, learning how to learn, that meta learning how to learn is such a complete thing.
[40:51] You have to learn how to do it. Nobody is born knowing how to learn, especially with neurodiversities that especially weren't
[41:02] taught years ago and how to get through them. Right.
[41:07] Because you don't learn like everybody else. Yep.
[41:10] And that book was very prescriptive in the sense that there were, like, it wasn't, you know, students should do, like, here are a bunch of different ideas, and students should
[41:22] do what works for them. It was very here are the things that students do or should do to be successful learners,
[41:31] so I guess I would say I don't recommend that book, at least not for the, like, teaching developers how to learn context.
[41:41] There were some really good tips. I just don't feel like they cover, like, for people who are teaching in, like, formal academic
[41:50] institutions, there were some really good learning tips in there. I just don't feel like it's everything because it doesn't address different learning needs
[42:04] and stuff like that. But learning how you yourself learn, well, first of all, just acknowledging that we have
[42:15] to learn how to learn, I feel like is at least half the battle. And then most of the rest of the battle is recognizing that when your amygdala is activating
[42:32] that fight or flight mode, that's when you have to stay. Or if you cannot, like, Jen, you had to, like, step away and take a break and come back the
[42:47] next day. And that is also totally a strategy.
[42:51] Oh, hey, Ramon. But, yeah, that's when the learning is happening.
[43:00] And it's hard because as a professor, I found that students generally were really, really resistant to the way that I taught.
[43:15] Because what they wanted from a math professor is somebody who stands at the board, and they solve 35 problems, and then that's it, more or less.
[43:29] And so, like, they just watch. And they're, like, writing it down.
[43:32] And so, they feel like they're learning. Because they're watching somebody do something, and that person is having success.
[43:38] And they're, like, oh, okay, yeah, I understand why you did A, and then B, and then C, and then D, and then we were done.
[43:44] Okay, great. I understand how to do this problem.
[43:48] But then when you sit down to do the homework and you're trying to do a problem that is so similar, but you still, like, you're not exactly sure, like, oh, wait, I thought I
[44:01] understood why when we had A, then we had to do B. But now I don't understand why we had to do B. And so, now, I have a situation where I don't know when I have to do B and
[44:15] when I don't. Because I don't know what B is for.
[44:18] And that happens all the time in programming. Right?
[44:22] Especially if what you're doing is pattern matching. So, you're looking at code that somebody else wrote and you're, like, adapting it to do
[44:31] something else. If you don't understand what a particular piece of code is, like, line of code is for,
[44:38] then you might be using it where you don't need it. Or not using it where you do need it, because you don't know what it's for.
[44:45] It's totally a thing. And that happens in math all the time, too.
[44:48] And so, that I think is but it feels so much better to watch somebody do a lecture and you feel like you got it and then you don't find out until later that you don't got it.
[45:06] It feels so much better than finding out that you don't got it. Right?
[45:12] >> Hmm. I don't know.
[45:15] I say that because sometimes it's >> Feels safer. Let me say that.
[45:23] It feels safer. Not better.
[45:25] Safer. Sorry, I totally interrupted you.
[45:30] >> I'm still thinking it through in the fact that it's almost like I don't know. Sometimes figuring it out later can prevent sheeple.
[45:53] Because you would have had to learn something based on the context that you learned it from and if nobody's disagreeing with you, the way they meant it or the way it's supposed
[46:03] to be taught may not actually be the right way to be taught because other people may make other neuro connections where they may be right too.
[46:22] >> I'm trying to process what you said. >> I know.
[46:28] I think I'm getting a little too philosophical. >> I'm not sure what you mean, I guess.
[46:30] Because like here's an example of like the kind of thing that I mean is like I would instead of solving 35 problems and then saying bye bye, have fun doing your homework, I would
[46:40] solve like oh, we are, yes, yes, we are talking about learning how to learn, Ramon. In the context of maybe I should do a talk on this.
[46:52] So I would as a math professor, oh, no, with you, okay. We'll be working on Python, right?
[47:00] Like in our other stream, we'll be doing the Python and I don't tell you the answer. >> Okay.
[47:08] >> And I don't tell you how something works. >> Okay.
[47:11] >> And I let you poke at it and like if you like are, you know, totally stuck, I'll try to like help like guide you in a direction and like we'll try different things and see
[47:23] like does this work? No.
[47:26] Does the other thing work? No.
[47:29] Does this other thing works? And then we can figure out why the first two things didn't work and so on.
[47:33] As opposed to just saying type this and then type that. Okay, great.
[47:38] That worked. And now we can move on.
[47:40] >> Yes. And the way I was thinking it in that same example was like learning the chapter beforehand.
[47:53] So that's my understanding where even with like Josh, when Josh comes on the stream for TypeScript, it will be readjusting what I was learning, but a lot of times the connections
[48:08] I made were accurate, just not always in the order that was being taught. So that's what I was saying like, oh, yeah, you may not always want to be told that it
[48:19] was wrong, per se, because your connections could have been correct, just not in the order somebody else would have done it.
[48:28] >> Totally. But, but you won't find out.
[48:34] You won't you won't get to that point where you find out like, oh, I had connections here, but they were in the wrong order or something like that.
[48:42] >> If all you ever hear is a lecture, like in like a math lecture context, say, if it's always just a lecture, then you only ever like go, oh, okay, well, I thought I understood
[48:54] this thing, but actually we're doing it this other way. So I guess that thing was wrong and it might not have been.
[48:59] You have to be like working together, like it's a team effort. And what I have found is that students generally want it to be a unidirectional situation.
[49:17] Information flows from me into you, the end, as opposed to like a loop. >> Really quick.
[49:29] So I just started listening to it, but I feel like you are just like saying what this thing just said.
[49:35] There is a book I just started listening to on Audible said, how to say it words that make a difference.
[49:43] I'll share this here shortly. And what they were talking about is how, yes, there's like context and those type of things.
[49:50] I'm only like a couple chapters in, but one of the things they talk about is that together, that a lot of times when we say together, we're willing to go further than we are if
[50:05] we're told to do it alone. And that's a big reason why I started teaching tech is because I learned that my learning
[50:19] style is not exactly suitable for school, is what I have found, because I want to be able to talk things out with people, and it's, I mean, maybe now I'd be more successful,
[50:39] but back then, y'all, I was really awkward. Nobody wanted to talk to me.
[50:44] Like, literally, nobody wanted to talk to me. So maybe I just grew out of that phase.
[50:48] >> The educational system, like, I guess I want to gently draw a distinction between school and the style of institution that we call school in most places, because it's completely
[51:11] possible to, okay, I mean, I'm always talking about, I'm so sorry, y'all, I'm always talking about Montessori education, but at my kid's school, when he's in middle school, so throughout,
[51:29] we've talked about how in the lower ages, they'll be, the kids will be sprawled on the floor learning stuff, and so on.
[51:38] So they are, like, working together if they want to be. And then, like, as they get older, like, that stays true, and so, like, in the middle school,
[51:47] the history classroom, there are no desks. There's, like, a table that's big enough for maybe eight people to sit around, and then
[51:56] there is a sofa and a bunch of bean bags and a bunch of bookshelves and so on, because history class is a conversation.
[52:08] And math class is also a conversation. No desks.
[52:11] There's one table where everybody's, like, it's a square, and everybody's, like, facing each other.
[52:16] Yes. And the school your kids go to were Montessori schools, where majority of America is not
[52:26] that. Exactly.
[52:28] So I don't think that your learning style is not suited to school. I think that your learning style and most people's learning style is not suited to the
[52:46] type of, like, the style in which we educate people where, like, there are a bunch of desks, the teacher stands at the front of the room, the teacher imparts information, the students
[52:57] absorb information, people only talk when they raise their hands and are called upon, class is over, goodbye.
[53:07] Which I think is garbage for practically everybody. Yes, but I feel like we'll definitely go down a different rabbit hole if we go doing that,
[53:16] which we are very, very good at doing. Now I do want to mention that, yes, Ramon, we are totally talking about ways to learn,
[53:30] learning to learn, which has been a journey and a half, even for myself, and thanks for introducing me to Laura, because it's helped a lot.
[53:38] And then I've been reposting things that Ramon posted of, they had a, Dr. Barbara Oakley and Zach Persery, to talk about this very topic at a free boot camp they taught last
[53:59] year, and it is linked. And then also, semi-sort of related, the Programmers Brained by Belline Herman, I'm going to go
[54:17] with, please don't ask me how to say anybody's names. Or words in general, I'm not great at it.
[54:23] But the reason we're talking about this is, taking it back to the beginning, we were talking about Laura wanting to find some ideas to submit the CFP, and Laura has taught me how
[54:37] to learn better. And that is how we got to where we're at right now, if that's a good way of recapping it.
[54:49] I wonder if, I don't know, I see then this talk, and then I think, oh, I wonder, maybe I shouldn't try to write this talk, because somebody's already written this talk.
[55:02] Yeah, but that's not going to work for everybody. We all have different ways of saying things.
[55:08] It's true. This has happened so many times, where you've told me something, and I'm like, yeah, okay.
[55:14] And then Jay will say something, and I'm like, oh, it finally cracks. Or you've told me something seven times, like, functions, I know what functions are.
[55:26] I use functions all the time. And then I look at a book trying to describe functions, and I'm like, I don't know what
[55:31] the fuck this is. What's a function?
[55:33] Yeah. Yeah, I mean, sometimes our brains get stuck on, oh, I don't know, we'll have, I think
[55:46] it's some kind of an unconscious memory, or we remember having found something really hard at one point, and then our brain just pings on that.
[56:00] We see the word, and then we're like, oh, that's that scary thing. And then get stuck in there, and we have to, like, talk ourselves out of it, like, oh,
[56:10] that was a scary thing. And then I turned on the light, and it turned out that it was okay, but now every time I,
[56:19] you know, see this word, I have to, like, go through these motions. I'm still kind of convinced something's gonna happen.
[56:27] I just am like, you know, the boogie monster may be gone right now, but they're gonna be back.
[56:37] Try having a panic attack while camping, trying to find the restroom at night with no flashlight, and you couldn't find your glasses.
[56:48] Oh, no. Nope.
[56:50] That was a shit show. I say that because, like, those are the type of things that I'm like, okay, if I can do
[56:59] that, I can get through what I'm trying to learn, it'll happen. I don't know if that's what other people do to try to get through shitty situations.
[57:08] I just try to think of a shittier situation that I've gotten through to get through it. I don't, I'm not sure if it's logical, but it works.
[57:18] Yeah. So what are other things in developer education that interest you?
[57:24] I don't know. That just sort of seems like it could be a niche for me, because that's, my background
[57:34] is in education. And so on.
[57:38] I don't know. You already taught a developer how to learn.
[57:44] That's true. That's weird to say.
[57:46] I'm a developer. You totally are.
[57:48] This feels really weird to say. I hear you.
[57:57] What do you think you might submit a talk for? I don't know.
[58:03] Did any of my topics work for doing less for more, more for less? I mean, I feel like there's an angle in there.
[58:20] I don't know if everybody else was here. I also could copy and paste these real quick and standby while I awkwardly stare at my
[58:30] phone and try to. So for everybody that was not here at the very beginning, I decided that it would be
[58:39] really fun. And I decided, I did not decide, but I woke up to a bunch of random talk ideas.
[58:50] So I woke up enough to text them to myself. And it's a bunch of random ideas.
[58:58] I will share them here shortly. Okay.
[59:06] Yes. Bakari panic attacks suck.
[59:12] Ramon fed their dog and always think the person who gave a similar talk topic might not be at the conference from that perspective, for sure.
[59:26] And also similar. They know what it's like to learn JavaScript, actually CoffeeScript, but still in 2010,
[59:34] you know what it's like to learn JavaScript in 2020 point being perspectives matter, general you not one of you in particular.
[59:44] Yeah, well, that's good because I didn't learn JavaScript in 2020. I didn't know what was going on in the world.
[59:54] I was trying to learn like camera shit, and it was not fun. Okay, hey, make it all fit it last screenshot.
[60:05] Yay. Okay, done.
[60:07] Save. All of these are duplicated.
[60:09] I will share my screen here shortly, because I'm texting them to myself. But hey, a half awake Jen couldn't figure out how else to get them down and then I woke
[60:22] up, which sucks. I don't want to wake up.
[60:25] Yep. Okay.
[60:27] Get a demos. Okay.
[60:29] Please stand by. Screen share.
[60:31] I am. I am sleepy.
[60:33] I had to be up at 4am today to take Brendan to the airport. I'm like, sleepy.
[61:03] Yeah, no, thank you. Okay.
[61:07] So it comes from this one. This one is first.
[61:11] Learning live is life saving. How learning live unlocks the gate to tech.
[61:20] Ramon already left. I think they would have liked this one of I'm a potato ideas to use your neurodiversity
[61:27] to your advantage. Socializing causes me for a four to four or four debug in your sleep.
[61:36] How naps are your most undervalued tool, there's supposed to be an elder breaking through. I don't want to how analysis paralysis keeps us from success.
[61:48] Noobs aren't here to steal your job. How to ask better questions to get help from those who don't want to help you.
[61:57] Why tech? Why does tech gatekeep and how to become secure while helping others?
[62:04] Pros and cons of saying fuck it. Types of ducks and how having data types can help your ducking code.
[62:14] And learning in public overcoming I don't know how saying I don't know out loud can help your career.
[62:22] Being secure in your role and use your privilege to level the playing field. They don't bite unless you're a beginner.
[62:31] Overcoming the shame of saying I don't know and debugging dyslexia. Those are the ideas.
[62:39] Yeah. So I'm trying to think about how to relate them to dev rel in particular.
[62:51] And like from there, like which ones would fit the theme of doing more with less? Or any of the other things.
[62:59] What were they? Developer education and something.
[63:01] Developer success. I think they all could really go into developer success.
[63:03] Oops. Didn't mean to do that.
[63:05] There we go. Scrolling back through the comments.
[63:07] Yeah. They all could.
[63:23] But I think it's definitely something that I don't know. I'll have to noodle on it because I actually have been asking my mentor at work for help
[63:37] on this. So I'm excited to show him all of these random ideas.
[63:43] Yeah. Because I'm like there are a lot of them.
[63:47] What do I do with them now? I have your one about naps.
[63:54] I have a blog post started but not finished called "How Taking Every Afternoon Off Increases My Productivity."
[64:05] Nice. Because I do, in fact, take every afternoon off in the sense that I work in two shifts,
[64:15] I guess. And this is just like my style.
[64:18] It's nothing to do with – nobody imposed this upon me except my biology, I suppose. So I do like a really good shift of work from like 8 to 1-ish.
[64:31] And then I am not very useful between 1 and about 8.30 PM, in fact. And then I get another really good burst from like 8.30 to like 11 or midnight.
[64:48] And so I work in two bits and I also kind of sleep in two bits. So I'll sleep from like midnight to, you know, 6.30 or so.
[65:03] And then I have a nap somewhere in the middle of that like I am not useful now afternoon. And I tried last week to pretend that that wasn't a thing.
[65:19] And I tried to keep working past 1 PM and I got nowhere. And I felt terrible and useless and so on.
[65:28] And I ended up, I was like, "Okay, I guess I am just going to take a nap because I'm not actually making any progress and I'm sleepy."
[65:34] And I had my nap and I woke up, had some coffee, and at 8.30 I was like, "I'm ready to go." And I worked until midnight.
[65:42] And then I was like, "I knew this. I already knew this about myself.
[65:46] Why did I pretend that I didn't know this about myself and beat myself up about it?" Okay.
[65:54] I do feel that part. But I feel like we all kind of like, it's good to test things.
[65:59] Are we still the way we created this habit around? Like, I'm not going to lie, I still try to eat gluten from time to time.
[66:10] I'm like, "I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it."
[66:13] No, I really shouldn't have done that. But I've also learned because of that, that I can eat a little more gluten than I thought
[66:22] I could. If I have like chicken nuggets, I will be okay.
[66:30] If I were to have a beer or pizza that is just all, all the gluten-y, I will be suffering severely.
[66:38] Cheesecake, I can eat it with a crust. Now dairy, since cheesecake is dairy too, ice cream will kill me.
[66:49] Milk will kill me. Like I will be in the bathroom crying where cream cheese, cheese, you know, cheesecake,
[67:02] I'm fine, totally fine. I say all of that because sometimes we have to find our, you know, our habits and then
[67:13] sometimes we have to test it, test to see if it is still right, where I have learned that especially with the new job, I wake up around four-ish and then take my medication
[67:34] to be on the call by five or six. I work until lunch and that's when I get ready for streaming normally and then I stream.
[67:44] I'm done by two. Sorry, I take the dog for a long walk and then I'm going to pass out for like 45 minutes
[67:50] and it's the best thing ever because then I'm like, "Oh, okay, like I'm, I'm figuring my way around this world."
[67:58] Yeah, it's also really weird because I'm like, "This is the longest day ever." Because 5 a.m. roughly to 8 p.m. feels like a very, very long time.
[68:15] So it's also, now my goal is finding out how do I, where in this new setup do I find motivation to do the dishes or laundry, but I'm like, "It's one step at a time."
[68:33] We're walking the dog every day, that's, that's a pretty good one for like a half-hour walk. That is the new good thing to do.
[68:40] If I try to do it all at once, I will explode and then won't get anywhere and we'll just go back to being a hermit in my bed.
[68:49] Hermit in the bed. I know.
[68:53] That's supposed to be totally me. I really wanted to hermit yesterday, even though I really had a lot of fun going out.
[69:01] And that is something that I, oh, that's another thing you could talk about. Outgoing introverts and needing to hermit.
[69:11] Yeah. In DevRel in particular?
[69:16] Yeah. Mm-hmm.
[69:18] Yeah, I think I'm just, if you don't use that one or you can't do and we can both submit, I think I really want to, I need to ask Ramona if this is okay, but I really want to use
[69:31] the one, "I'm a potato." Oh, are you concerned about like idea infringement with respect to the word potato?
[69:44] No. It's more of like, I think everybody could submit something because they're all going
[69:49] to be a little different. It's more, I wouldn't say idea infringement of, I wouldn't want people to get sad.
[69:59] If everybody's going for the same role, not everybody's going to be accepted. So if you do things similar, then it could cause hesitation.
[70:06] I don't think that's the right word, but role? I use role as example, but for the same talk, the same, anytimes multiple people or multiple
[70:20] friends are going to the same something. Oh, I get it, so you mean you don't want, like if Ramona was already submitting something
[70:30] along those lines. Yeah.
[70:32] Gotcha. And is he okay with me using his phrase, "I'm a potato"?
[70:36] So that's what I was going to say is I don't think that that's strictly Ramona's phrase. I agree, but I learned it from for Ramona, so I associate it with him.
[70:47] So I think that's also something that I am just personal about of like, who do I associate it with?
[70:54] And is it because I came up with that word because of them? Or did they say the word and I latched onto it?
[71:02] Because it could have a sentimental meaning to them. I like the phrase, "I'm a potato" because I grew up in Idaho, the potato state, and
[71:11] I love French fries and potatoes, like any type of potato. I really, really like potatoes.
[71:16] Yeah. And that's why I want to do, "I'm a potato."
[71:23] Good. But so many options.
[71:27] Yeah. So many things.
[71:29] Well, I hope today was helpful with getting ideas flowing. Totally.
[71:33] Yeah. I'm very low energy at the moment, and so I feel much more enthusiastic in my head than
[71:41] my body is conveying, because I'm a potato right now, let me tell you. I just want to, that I feel like should be our new phrase is, "I'm a potato on the outside.
[71:55] On the inside, it's a party." On Wednesday night, I have a concert to go to.
[72:04] Like my friend was like, "Yo, I got tickets, they're sold out, you should go with me." And I'm like, "You do know, they don't go on stage till my bedtime.
[72:15] I may be there completely enjoying myself, but yawning the entire time and may not be dancing that much."
[72:21] And she's like, "It's okay, as long as I know that you're enjoying yourself." And I'm like, "No, I'm so excited about this, but I might be potato-ing there."
[72:30] Yeah. Might be a potato at a concert, it might happen.
[72:35] Yep. That's a thing.
[72:37] Well, thank you, Laura, and enjoy the rest of your day. And I've got a couple streamer left, let's go put you over to their socials.
[72:50] Thanks. Hmm.
[72:52] They're a dope human. I don't know them.
[72:54] You should. They are cool.
[72:56] Yeah. They are in Utah.
[72:58] Okay. And are Russian, and helped me figure out some streaming things, but yeah.
