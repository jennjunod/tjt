[00:00] - Stuff, and we are now live. - Yay.
[00:04] - Hello. - Is this happy new year from DistributeAid?
[00:11] I think it is. - Happy new year from DistributeAid, 2023, y'all.
[00:16] I feel like I'm not asking for a good year or a bad year this year.
[00:23] Can we just have a neutral year? Can we just have a year where things like kinda go okay?
[00:27] You know what I'm saying? - Yes, please. - No extremes.
[00:31] No extremes. - Exactly, right?
[00:35] - Do people still say no something only vibes? - Only vibes.
[00:41] - Only vibes, yeah. - I have a musician in the background called my dog.
[00:46] She is whining at us. So I will be muting a bit more today.
[00:50] - Jen, we can't hear it at all. - Yes.
[00:53] - That's some good microphone you got there. - Sweet.
[00:57] - How are we doing? - I'm excited.
[01:03] - Greg King says they can hear. - Yeah, yeah.
[01:09] - I'm gonna raise my volume then. - No, my dog is annoying.
[01:13] - No. - Greg King, happy new year to you.
[01:16] Good to see you around. - Happy new year. So happy you're here.
[01:19] Hope you had a good... You know, in German speaking countries,
[01:23] they say a good rutsch into the new year. - Rutsch.
[01:27] - Rutsch, which is a slide. Like you slide into the new year.
[01:31] Oh, I did hear the dog this time. Sweetheart.
[01:37] - It's pretty adorable though. - Yeah.
[01:41] How about you two? You doing all right?
[01:43] - I'm distracted. Yes.
[01:48] I mean, I will say, and I told you to this, you know,
[01:53] you have some days that you're not as high energy and that's a day for me today.
[01:58] So... - And as I said, absolutely fine.
[02:02] You know, we all have our days. - And working on not being so distracted by the doggo.
[02:07] So if you see me moving around, it's because I'm trying to figure things out for her.
[02:13] - Yeah. That sounds good. - Wonderful.
[02:15] - That's what I love about that. As Ramon was saying, the vibes of the stream,
[02:18] it's just like very chill. Like there are plenty of days that I'm on with you, Ramon,
[02:22] and it's like not my best day, you know? I'm dealing with a stressful shipment
[02:26] or something like that. You're like, hey, I got this.
[02:28] Like I can run, you know, the get pod and like, let's just like do some fun, you know,
[02:33] like React coding. - But exactly, and this is the whole point of it, isn't it?
[02:38] It's to like, you know, let ourselves, like we're a team here.
[02:43] And yes, we're a team. Like, yes, the three of us are a team.
[02:46] Can I say that safely now? - Yes, yes.
[02:50] From what I've heard, Jen's accepted. We gotta, you know, get her a...
[02:55] Kind of volunteer, what do we even call them? Volunteer agreement, there we go.
[03:02] Do you want to make the big announcement, Jen or Ramon? - I'm gonna let Jen announce this.
[03:09] This is... - I'm doing some things and stuff
[03:14] and we're building a cool program for open source developers to become not distracted by their dog.
[03:24] And it has a... Yeah, you should probably just explain it, Ramon,
[03:32] because between that and what Nick said, I'm like, what is going on at the moment?
[03:40] But I'm doing cool things with you. That's what I know.
[03:44] - Very much. - It's into the vibes.
[03:49] Yeah. Can I jump in here, Ramon?
[03:51] I'm super excited. I'm thrilled to be working with Jen.
[03:54] So... - Sorry about that, am I still here?
[04:01] - You're still here now, you're gone for a second. - Fabulous, my bad, carry on.
[04:06] - Yep, so Jen is our new Developer Advocacy Coordinator. And if you all remember, in the last year,
[04:14] Ramon and I very kind of briefly introduced the start of an open source dev champions program.
[04:22] And Jen's gonna be taking lead on building that out. So excited to be working with her.
[04:28] I know that she does a lot of great work in the dev community and is really connected
[04:32] to a lot of like, we share a lot of mutual friends and contributors and stuff.
[04:37] And yeah, there's just some really great stuff going on at DA in 23.
[04:42] We're kind of collectively taking a step back as an org. Like, we put numbers on the board, bro.
[04:47] I'm excited, we sent 20 trucks of food in December. Got it organized, got it funded.
[04:54] - Do we have that visualized somewhere? Is there a tab I could be sharing?
[05:00] - Instagram is probably your best. We don't have a visualization up for it yet.
[05:05] We're still building out the data pipeline. But if you wanna show our Instagram,
[05:13] I think we're just distributing it on there. - I have to admit, I'm not very experienced with Instagram,
[05:18] but I hope I got this right. I tell Instagram because it's like
[05:22] a quick like visual overview, right? It's just a bunch of photos.
[05:26] So do we have a post about it? I might have.
[05:30] Yeah, USA, no, I don't know. One of those guys, maybe.
[05:38] Maybe it hasn't been posted and the stream gets the first peek at what's, you know--
[05:44] - Fabulous. - Point being, it's enough to feed 30,000 Ukrainians
[05:50] every day for a full month. That's 30,000 needs met right there.
[05:54] And I think what we realized is like, we've done what we can in terms of scaling trick, right?
[06:03] We don't have anything to prove to anyone anymore and we can handle stuff.
[06:06] And so now it's time to take a step back, really work on the fundamentals,
[06:12] really build out the pieces that we wish we were there right now
[06:15] so that we can do even more in the future. And I feel like that's what Jen's gonna be doing here
[06:20] on our tech side, right? How do we get organized?
[06:23] How do we support our contributors, right? How do we give people ownership
[06:27] of different parts of our code bases? How do we get help as maintainers, right?
[06:32] 'Cause like, I can contribute or maintain, it's hard to do both, you know?
[06:37] And how do folks contribute to Distribute Aid and level up by doing it?
[06:41] So absolutely thrilled, Jen, to be working with you on that.
[06:45] And we'll continue building it out on the open. And so everyone in the audience, keep showing up,
[06:50] keep being part of the DA community, keep contributing and tell us
[06:54] what you wanna get out of this Dev Champions program. - This is so exciting.
[07:01] - Just as a heads up everyone, especially those who are tuning in on Teach Jen Tech,
[07:07] we will be streaming on both channels because we definitely want to bring the awareness
[07:13] of Distribute Aid to Teach Jen Tech crew. And also just making sure that y'all keep up
[07:21] with all the random shit I'm learning. So making sure that it's on both channels.
[07:26] So if you get confused, I am working on making the graphics so you know what you're tuning into for the day.
[07:32] - I love that. Actually, I got inspired
[07:34] and that's why I had a little moment of blip. You might've noticed, Jen and Taylor,
[07:39] that I also added my Twitch channel to this. So now we're reaching a couple more people.
[07:42] - What, what, welcome new people. - I don't know why it didn't occur to me to do this sooner.
[07:47] Like I'm such a mess, but hey, we're here. Howdy everybody.
[07:51] It's been a while. - Got Noel on the chat.
[07:53] Happy New Year, Noel. Good to see you again. - Noel is here.
[07:55] Yes. Happy New Year, Noel.
[07:58] Hey, good to see you. Yeah.
[08:02] Well, before we go into talking a little bit further about what Jen will be doing
[08:07] as a Developer Advocacy Coordinator. Did I get the title right?
[08:10] - You got it right, yeah. - Ah, first try too.
[08:12] I'm proud. Let's cover a little bit of what you have been up to,
[08:19] Taylor, in the last couple of weeks with Distribute Aid. I hear there's an impending launch of sorts.
[08:25] - Yes. So a couple of exciting things,
[08:27] like I said, on the aid side, we're got a surge of kind of end of year shipping
[08:34] as tends to happen. So working on wrapping those up,
[08:37] but I mean, got a full truck of medicine out to Ukraine, had, you know, I think a Calais truck
[08:44] in Northern France arrived at the 20 trucks of food. That's still wrapping that one up and yeah.
[08:50] And then I'm getting ready for new shipping stuff and it's going great.
[08:54] I'm thrilled, absolutely thrilled with the team soon, but what they're excited about, right?
[08:59] They can do as much shipping as they wanna do. They're excited to document what they've learned.
[09:03] They're excited to, you know, get that knowledge down on paper,
[09:06] both for future DA Logistics Coordinators, future DA Admins, but also for our community
[09:12] to learn with us. And folks have been working really hard
[09:17] on our tech this year. This is why we do open source tech, right?
[09:21] Because we have that solution. There are so many folks, including Brad Kane,
[09:25] Noel have contributed to the Distribute Aid code base. And so we're also trying to get those
[09:31] across the finish line with this next launch and then kind of have a clean slate
[09:36] to look at our 2023 roadmap. So Ramon, do you wanna show everyone
[09:41] what's on the cards right now? - With pleasure.
[09:45] So I see a couple of new things on our website. Taylor, cool to just sort of step through them
[09:54] and do some discovery, for example. - Please, go for the world.
[09:58] - So we've got, we've got our, so we've got the routes we had before.
[10:04] The regions are new. Have a look at those.
[10:09] My, oh, my. So now we've got cool new graphics
[10:14] for each of the regions. - I was so happy 'cause we have the Google Maps
[10:20] screenshots up there as like a placeholder and our admin team got so inspired
[10:25] that one of them went and created, like they found all the different maps
[10:29] and kind of loaded it up and added the colors and everything.
[10:32] Yeah, yeah, definitely. - This is super cool, Taylor.
[10:37] And, you know, it kind of, like it kind of reminds me of our spinning earth,
[10:41] you know, like it's round like the planet and this is like Eastern Europe, France.
[10:46] I think the data needs some updating 'cause it says France has a population of zero.
[10:50] - It's still a work in progress, so, you know. - Pretty sure it's a little bit more than that.
[10:54] (laughs) - Yeah.
[10:57] - But it's all good, it's all good. This looks fantastic.
[11:01] - Thank you. And like, thank you, everybody.
[11:03] There's so many people that contributed, you know, to the, like Ramon,
[11:08] I remember almost a year ago, like kind of starting to build out
[11:11] the early stages of this with you. There's so many people,
[11:14] if you click in on the region pages that have contributed to making that happen, right?
[11:20] And so I feel like I'm in like the really lucky position of being able to integrate a lot of people's work, right?
[11:25] And kind of, you know, give it a consistent set of styling or whatever,
[11:29] you know, but this isn't my code. I'm just like stitching together all of these PRs
[11:33] that have been merged in, you know, and just trying to get them launched
[11:37] and across the finish line here. - The life of an open source maintainer.
[11:41] - Yeah. I do have a question for you and Jen
[11:43] and anyone in the audience on experimenting if you scroll up with this sort of like
[11:48] unique menu format, right? It's a little bit of, you know,
[11:52] like where it's like dot, dot, dot, right? Like I have this on Wikipedia or something,
[11:56] if you have like-- - Breadcrumbs.
[11:58] - Yeah. So how do y'all feel about that kind of style
[12:04] for breadcrumbs and maybe click on one of the sub-regions as well to see how it works for them.
[12:08] - Yeah. So we got all regions.
[12:11] This is the current region, which is Eastern Europe. Interesting, 'cause it goes like this
[12:15] and then like it shows where we are and then these are the sub-regions.
[12:18] Let me click on one. I'll click.
[12:20] Oh goodness. We'll go with Romania.
[12:24] - What? Maybe a little bit of styling adjustments
[12:29] on the sub-region pages. It looks a bit close together there.
[12:34] - This one here you mean? Or like--
[12:36] - Yeah, like on the nav links, like the arrows seem kind of close
[12:38] to the links there or something. - Interesting.
[12:42] - Yeah. - I am only, the only thing I can,
[12:47] I don't know if I would necessarily register that's what it meant.
[12:51] Yeah, like what Bedrock said of, like I could get used to it,
[13:01] but I think if I, like if there was a word that was added to it,
[13:06] like here, I don't know. - Oh yeah.
[13:11] - Or like something to like get people used to that icon. - Yeah.
[13:20] - And then like, if you started using that more often, eventually it could be solo.
[13:24] - Yeah, no, and that's what I'm asking for is like, are people gonna understand this as breadcrumbs
[13:30] or do we need to help frame it better or adjust the design?
[13:33] 'Cause there's a little bit of a weird one, which I thought it was like,
[13:36] I was playing around with it yesterday and I thought it was kind of fun.
[13:39] But yeah, like if people don't know that Romania is in Eastern Europe,
[13:45] that can feel kind of random, right? Like, and what's that--
[13:49] - Oh yeah, that's what I want, is for it to say the city or country or with it, yes.
[13:58] - Yeah, building bedrock layout says, it's not a common icon across the web.
[14:02] So I think a few more hints as to what that means would work,
[14:04] which is a solid tip, thank you. And I think, by the way, I love that
[14:10] we have an image for it too, super cool. I think what I'm missing
[14:17] just from an accessibility perspective is some kind of like ARIA label.
[14:22] - Yeah, definitely. I kind of wanted to like see if it would make sense first
[14:26] and then go in and do a second map across the styles and add accessibility,
[14:30] but good to call that out, right? - Yeah, totally.
[14:34] - Yeah. - But this is like a very cool concept.
[14:39] And we've got a question from Nick Rizal, is SEO important in general or like?
[14:46] (laughing) - Well, they asked earlier about React versus I think Next.
[14:54] And we haven't gone over too much of like what we're using. So Nick Rizal, what are you looking for?
[15:05] Is it just like a curiosity of like the languages we use and why that's going into SEO and how we do that?
[15:12] Like, what are you overall wanting to learn about? - If I may venture an attempt here,
[15:20] I think SEO is going to have its relevance if people are looking for, say,
[15:24] how to distribute aid in, for example, Moldova, in, for example, Slovakia.
[15:33] So having those relevant pages be SEO, powerfully SEO-ish is a good,
[15:44] I think that's the correct term, yes, is relevant. And I think there's different like parts of the site
[15:52] where it's more or less relevant, right? Like definitely these region pages,
[15:58] you can try to have content to get them out there. To the general public, it could be helpful.
[16:06] And something like our connection, right? We're also, like the site very much exists
[16:11] for our network, right? And so we'll be sending people links directly
[16:15] and referring them to information on the site or to the different tools that we put out
[16:20] through the site. So it's kind of a weird hybrid of like,
[16:23] it's our public landing site, right? And we want people to discover it,
[16:26] but we're also like almost more concerned about using it to support our network,
[16:31] you know, as the interface to our knowledge and to our tools, if that makes sense.
[16:36] - Yeah, makes sense to me. Yeah, no, super, super cool.
[16:41] This is stunning work, Taylor, but of course it's only one part of it
[16:45] 'cause there's also a needs tab. Shall I jump into that
[16:49] or was there something I missed here? - Go for it.
[16:51] - All right, let's do it. Let's look at the needs page real quick.
[16:54] And this, whew, this is the big one. Why don't you guide us through a little bit, Taylor?
[17:00] - Right on. So I actually want you to start,
[17:02] I got to flip these on the actual thing. Let's just scroll down and take a look
[17:05] at our first graph that we're putting out here, right? This is our needs data explorer.
[17:11] And before we dive into all the options, we now have a full year's worth of digitally collected,
[17:18] like, kind of needs assessment survey results, right? And that's enough data to start doing yearly capacity planning
[17:24] and really trying to get ahead of needs, you know? Go ask for those big in-kind donations
[17:30] for something that we'll need six months from now, right? Because we know what that looks like.
[17:35] And this is information we definitely use internally, but we want to make it actionable, right?
[17:40] So when I talk about, you know, how are people going to use this, you know,
[17:45] this is clearly a fairly advanced view, but it lets our coordinators
[17:49] or lets kind of power users put together the view that they need to show people.
[17:54] So Ramon, here's a... Austria.
[18:00] Oh, my power just came back on. I'm not going to drop out of the stream now.
[18:04] Oh my gosh. - Oh, fantastic.
[18:05] Yeah, folks, if you were wondering, poor Taylor comes onto the stream and he's like,
[18:10] "I'm so sorry, y'all, I might drop halfway through because I'm tethering from my phone."
[18:14] So things should get a little bit more stable now, at least for internet, so.
[18:18] - Yay. - Thank goodness for that.
[18:21] Got a question from Building Bedrock Layout who says, "The main landing area should be SEO friendly, right?
[18:25] But as you go deeper, maybe not as much." And I think the important part there is
[18:31] what the purpose of the landing site is, which is to sort of like bring awareness
[18:37] to Distribute Aid itself over and what it does, what they do, over say what Distribute Aid does
[18:45] in a specific region. - Yeah, yeah.
[18:51] I think that's the SEO we care about is like, we do this globally, right?
[18:56] So we're not actually the experts on like the conflict in Ukraine right now, right?
[19:00] We send aid to our partners. Like we have our own setup that handles our response there,
[19:07] but we're not more knowledgeable than the UN or other people that are putting out
[19:11] these like very detailed large reports. But if you're the right type of group, right?
[19:17] If you're a grassroots group trying to help out, right? Help refugees in Europe, help natural disasters in the US,
[19:25] we want you to discover this, right? And we want you to understand that we can help you, right?
[19:30] As that sort of like kind of ideal user. And then like, if you want to dive deeper,
[19:36] if you're like, "Oh, I work in Northern France." You can check out who we work with in Northern France,
[19:41] kind of other information about our response on that region's page.
[19:45] So I'd agree. I like this approach of like generally SEO friendly
[19:49] for the landing site part of it, but also like there's a funnel, right?
[19:55] We want to guide people to the right part of that funnel in different areas of the site.
[19:59] Not everything needs to be perfectly discoverable on its own.
[20:03] Let's get people in the front door and then guide them to the right thing.
[20:08] So is that like, does that approach make sense? Not an SEO expert by any means, a little bit.
[20:15] I was trying to be like, this is what we're trying to do. I don't know.
[20:19] - No, same, same. No, you're good.
[20:23] Cool. Okay, so this is, so sorry, back to the needs bar chart.
[20:29] So this is a piece of functionality you're working on that allows us to share essentially from all of the data
[20:36] that is being accumulated by DistributeAid as they coordinate this aid relief
[20:42] to be able to be presented in a way that is sort of modularized
[20:47] in that folks can create their own links and visualizations and display dating accordingly.
[20:52] Is that correct? - Exactly.
[20:54] Yeah, we want to make the data actionable. We've been using that dog food as data
[20:59] and definitely like to get in kind of agents doing swaps between people.
[21:06] Now it's to publicize it, but just saying like, oh, great,
[21:10] we like on these surveys, get actionable. So if you scroll to the top,
[21:14] let's get into all these options. - Really quick, Taylor.
[21:17] And I don't know if it's just me. - I was just typing to you, to all of you.
[21:22] - Is your internet back on? 'Cause you're breaking up pretty bad
[21:28] and I don't know if you can swap to your like normal internet.
[21:31] - Yeah, I could try doing that for sure. Give me a second here.
[21:37] Ramon, if you want to go index by item, right? And select a region,
[21:43] like just play around with the settings here. Not on the group by, but on the filter, right?
[21:48] Try to get like, how would you use this data to make it actionable?
[21:52] Have fun, I'll be back in two minutes and then I can keep watching folks there.
[21:56] - Awesome, thank you. Yeah, I mean, so for context, everyone,
[22:01] like this is something that Taylor started like briefly showing off as the end of the year came around
[22:06] and like, it just went from there. So this is a way for allowing you folks who are working,
[22:14] you know, this data is open and free for folks to be able to experiment with.
[22:19] And so for example, if I pick index by item, all of the items that are in Eastern Europe
[22:26] and we can see there a breakdown of all of these items, just like all the way down.
[22:35] You can see what folks are bringing over around, say in Eastern Europe.
[22:42] - This is the last conversation. So when you're ready, Ramon, I just sent you a photo.
[22:51] - Oh yeah. - Like, I think a way that it'll be easier
[22:55] for that icon to make sense. So since you're sharing your screen,
[22:59] I just sent it over to you. - Yeah, let me see if I can open that.
[23:03] I love it. I love it.
[23:05] - Check it out, Jen made a... - Oh, okay.
[23:08] - Just putting the icon by each of them, I think would show, oh, that means that it's by it.
[23:15] Like that means that that's there, Jen, Jen. So, Jen. - Cool.
[23:23] - Jen. - This is, and in case anyone is curious,
[23:26] this is why I love streaming with these two is because my ADHD self is gonna be off
[23:32] in like la-la land where at least they can continue going and I'm not slowing the conversation because I...
[23:40] Oh, yay. Welcome everyone from Learn with Jason.
[23:46] - Ooh, hello. - What up, what up?
[23:49] - Yay. And we are working with Distributade
[23:54] and we are currently streaming to a few of us so that way we can go through
[24:02] and Taylor, talk about what Distributade is because you're the best at the things.
[24:08] - We'll do the overview. So, Distributade, I'm a confident person.
[24:13] We don't know, but I feel like I can say it and if we learn otherwise, that's okay.
[24:18] We run the world's largest mutual aid supply chain. So let's break that down, world global scale.
[24:24] We operate in the United States, in Europe, including Eastern Europe and in Lebanon right now.
[24:31] We're very much designing our supply chain and our tech in a way that like eventually
[24:36] can reach most places on this planet because we deal with global crises, right?
[24:42] You know, I think COVID really taught us that one. Mutual aid, we're interested in solidarity, not charity.
[24:49] You know, we're not interested in like sending things 'cause like it makes us feel good
[24:53] or because like we have like the resources to do that. We're interested in building systems that help people
[25:00] and using supply chains and technology to do that and figuring out how to do that at scale
[25:06] and like a scale of, you know, starting with grassroots all the way up to like,
[25:10] how do these networks help everybody together? And supply chain, we ship things.
[25:17] Ramon, if you could jump back to our Instagram real quick. Trucks, containers, you know, pallets,
[25:26] we tend to stay away from individual boxes and things like that.
[25:29] But yeah, just scroll through a little bit. So we, I think we operate in about 12 countries
[25:36] and do some really interesting logistics and supply chain work.
[25:43] We deliberate, right? And we do that at the scale of $15 million
[25:49] from an all-volunteer team. So yeah.
[25:55] - And to add to that really quick, because I know a lot of people were watching Jason
[26:01] with Daniel about Nuxt and we do. So I'm probably the least technical here
[26:09] and these two are like super technical. So yes, we may be using all of this as a focus
[26:16] on open source with distributed to put it towards, you know, a good resource.
[26:21] Yet there are a lot of, of it is the technical side of it.
[26:28] And we use it as a teaching platform as why we're also working on launching a new project
[26:35] that we just announced today, that we will be, if you think of something
[26:40] like Microsoft's champions, or I forget what they're all called,
[26:45] or GitHub, or, you know. - There's the Mozilla tech speakers, right?
[26:49] That reminds me. - Yeah, there's so many.
[26:51] So we are working on starting that, but for open source. So, and walking through those programs.
[26:58] So hang out with us on Thursdays, like definitely hit follow if you're interested in it
[27:04] or have input, because this is something that, I mean, for those who are into open source,
[27:09] this is literally for everyone. And it helps people get into tech
[27:14] because breaking into tech is terrifying. That's why I have the show called Teach Gen Tech,
[27:19] which yes, I got my name and kind of copied, learn with Jason, just Jason's is much more technical
[27:25] and mine's like for very beginners. - Gotcha.
[27:30] Well, and I feel like we hit that nice middle sweet spot, right?
[27:32] Like we're so inspired by the open source world and use a lot of concepts that came out of open source tech
[27:39] in our like this humanitarian aid space, right? And getting people to document knowledge publicly, right?
[27:46] Kind of like spinning up these like open offer community services and stuff, very inspired.
[27:53] And we're dealing with two different solidarity economies. There's the solidarity economy
[27:57] and the open source kind of tech space. There's the solidarity economy
[28:00] and this kind of grassroots aid network space and open source at the aid brings those two together, right?
[28:07] The code we write helps move atoms in the real world to support people in need and do that
[28:14] in a sustainable and reliable manner. So I think it's a super cool, but like Jen said,
[28:20] like very beginner friendly, like we're all volunteers. We're just here to have a good time, right?
[28:24] It's gotta be a good time for people to stick around. You gotta learn and grow and support your own career.
[28:30] And I think that's what Jen's gonna really help us build out this year with the Dev Champions Program
[28:35] is like you get to contribute code to an awesome open source project
[28:39] and get something to show your employer, right? And get a sweet story to tell your teammates
[28:46] when you get that job or whatever. So yeah.
[28:49] - Indeed. - Yeah.
[28:51] - Yeah. - All right.
[28:54] - I think it's time to plug our donate page. Ramon, that's pretty new.
[28:57] Do we wanna show all the new folks where the donate page is?
[29:00] - Let's do it. - Do you like our work?
[29:02] - Open collective. So as always, you can contribute.
[29:05] - No, no, no. We have a new distributeaid.org/donate.
[29:08] We don't have to use- - Oh my goodness.
[29:10] You're right. - Yeah, yeah.
[29:12] Like I said, everything, we're trying to get it all out the door.
[29:15] - Here we go. - So you can see our different projects,
[29:18] find out more info. You can click donate,
[29:21] it'll take you to the right place on the internet. If you like what we do, please support it.
[29:27] We deliver a lot of aid and we are very efficient. Every dollar you donate delivers $87
[29:34] worth of humanitarian aid. And like I said, we're a grassroots,
[29:38] all volunteer, open source team, so. - And this is what Thursdays are about.
[29:44] So definitely hang out with us on Thursdays. The rest of the week is, let's see,
[29:49] Monday is just like hanging out with Laura, which is miscellaneous Mondays.
[29:55] And we work through, like this week, we work through lighting and next Monday,
[30:00] we're gonna be working through OBS. And on Fridays, we talk about Python
[30:06] and TypeScript every other Friday. So a lot.
[30:10] Mattering on the day, you're just gonna get surprised with some goodness.
[30:14] But on Thursdays, it's all distributed. - There we go.
[30:18] Cool. - But I liked my graphic when everybody joined in
[30:22] and I was like, oh, there's people. I feel like a graphic like that
[30:28] will help with the coordination. Ooh, this is a good one.
[30:36] Do you coordinate with other nonprofits that have similar goals?
[30:41] - Yes, great question. We don't want to become a big institution.
[30:46] We're taking a very 21st century kind of network building approach
[30:51] to the organizing that we do. And we're trying to solve supply chain
[30:57] almost as a utility layer, right? And offer different services
[31:01] that are open to these other groups, right? Thinking of it more as almost like an API layer, right?
[31:07] If you wanna help people in your community, can you tell someone your needs
[31:10] who are just going out there after getting those donations? Can you bring a pallet into some community storage hub?
[31:18] So I think the whole point is to do this, working with other people,
[31:23] get more people involved in these kind of humanitarian and aid movements,
[31:27] make it more accessible to them. And right now, we work with over 150 organizations
[31:34] in a dozen different countries. So we're not gonna expand to new regions for the next year
[31:41] without hoping to kind of double down on those relationships and help grow more groups,
[31:45] help get more groups into the aid movement and onto our supply chain, yeah.
[31:51] - Something that comes to mind, especially about right before we were looking at the design,
[32:00] when you were going through... Ramon, you were going through the page
[32:05] where it was like the breakdown of... Yeah, I don't remember. - Oh, the graphs.
[32:11] - Yeah, yeah. So something that I'm curious about,
[32:15] and I know you were looking at behind the scenes a bit, of how was this made?
[32:21] - So the story for something like this kind of follows our usual tech development approach.
[32:30] I'm gonna get on my soapbox here just 'cause... - Do it. - How do we build something?
[32:35] How did this come to happen? It starts on the kind of aid worker side, right?
[32:42] We needed to solve a very practical logistics problem. What do people need?
[32:46] Can we project that need? Can we use that to go after in-kind donors
[32:51] and tell them like, you can't just approach a big company and say, give me socks and underwear.
[32:55] You can approach them and say, in this region, for this response you might care about,
[32:59] I need 5,000 pairs of socks and 5,000 pairs of underwear broken down by these sizes and stuff like that.
[33:05] So we just started asking people quarterly, could you tell us what you need?
[33:11] Got a whole messy set of data, built a structure, and kind of went through Google Forms
[33:16] and then tried Qualtrics, but couldn't afford the license. So we're like, hey, let's build our own tool.
[33:21] And Marcus was the lead on that project. He built a needs assessment survey tool,
[33:29] and kind of a database, backing that data in an API to provide summary results, right?
[33:34] We don't want to release individual group surveys, but we'll release summaries for each sub-region.
[33:39] So huge shout out to him. I think that's a great example, Jen,
[33:44] as people go through our Dev Champions Program, right? Like contribute to the existing projects,
[33:49] contribute to the landing site, but really hoping to identify open source leaders
[33:54] through that program who can take on their own projects and help us build other tools, just like Marcus did.
[34:01] So I kind of came in here. I wanted to set the stage
[34:05] because this is not the only data source we have. We have a whole shipment data reporting,
[34:10] kind of our impact reporting pipeline that we've been building out and getting data together for,
[34:15] but we need the capability on our landing site to show this data off.
[34:19] So I kind of went in and used this as my excuse to set up that, and we're using Nevo Graphs.
[34:27] There's a ton of different types of graphs out there that people could do.
[34:31] And yeah, like figured out the data ingestion through Gatsby and just kind of plugged it into one of those Nevo Graphs
[34:39] and then set up these controls, right? People could even add more controls,
[34:43] but I wanted to do one kind of end-to-end feature like this myself to say like,
[34:49] "Hey, here's an example you can refer to in our code base. Here's an approach."
[34:53] I'm open to criticism. I'm open to like doing things different ways,
[34:56] but at least here's a starting point, right? And again, bringing that to what you're building out,
[35:01] this is what Lourdes can afford. Who's like really excited to take some awesome,
[35:05] interesting data and a great visualization library and put the two together to come up with new graphs
[35:12] and new charts and help provide new answers with the data we already have.
[35:16] Who wants to like get into the backend and work on kind of automating our data pipeline
[35:22] so that when we deliver 20 trucks of food to Ukraine, that can get to the landing site the next day
[35:28] instead of three months later, in a PDF quarterly report, right?
[35:33] So I think we can dive into more of what Ramon and I talked about last time,
[35:38] but definitely want to use the program you're building to set up these pathways for contributors
[35:46] where they feel supported. Like we know we can support them.
[35:48] We know there's an example there. There's a code C map,
[35:51] shout out to our sponsors at Code C, showing you where in the code base
[35:56] you're going to need to look for different things and then help people develop their confidence
[36:01] and develop their skillset by giving them a structured way to contribute to DA over time
[36:07] and like building up their repertoire through that. - I think one of the things that excites me the most
[36:17] about building this out and making this data accessible is that it is built in such a way to make these shareable.
[36:25] Do you want to take us a little bit through this link field here?
[36:28] - Yes. So the first thing I want you to do, Ramon,
[36:31] go back to the top. Let's change categories to items.
[36:36] - Yes. - Let's group by sub-region.
[36:41] Let's group by sub-region. Let's index by item.
[36:45] - That's it. - And then let's select Greece maybe from the filter.
[36:52] And if we could change the sort to value and change the order.
[36:58] I've messed up my tests and the orders are reversed. So change it to, maybe change it to ascending.
[37:05] - Okay. - Maybe I didn't mess it up.
[37:06] - Whoa. - So that's what I'm talking about, right?
[37:09] We have now taken a bunch of data and visualized it to create an answer
[37:13] that will get people needed items, like basic humanitarian,
[37:17] like what does it take to survive stuff, right? This is a list of the past year's worth of data for Greece,
[37:24] ranking those items by the number of needed items. We can translate that to like monthly needs.
[37:30] You know, sometimes you need a lot of diapers, but only a couple sets of clothes or something, right?
[37:34] So we can kind of combine it with other data sets and kind of continue to discover answers through it.
[37:40] But like, if someone's like, what does Greece need? I wanna support refugees there.
[37:44] This is the graph that I send them. And they take this and they produce, you know,
[37:48] a whole ton of amazing stuff, right? We'll produce, you know, kind of like,
[37:53] how many collection events do we need? What should we tell people
[37:56] to bring to those collection events? People take this to in-kind donors.
[38:00] Hey, if your company has overstocked, here's the list of things we'll automatically accept, right?
[38:05] And we can also take this and use it for advocacy and highlight, you know, what is the size and scale
[38:11] of like the unmet humanitarian needs there to agencies and governments that like
[38:17] might have the ability to do something about it or might not be interested in helping these people,
[38:22] but we can at least tell them like, this is the gap that you're leaving,
[38:25] that our network is, (coughs) excuse me, is trying to fill.
[38:31] - Really quick. I just wanna call out one of the comments that we just got.
[38:35] It's Homie, and we all adore Homie and you are- - He's still coming up from here.
[38:43] (laughs) - So for those who don't know who Homie is,
[38:48] he is literally everyone's Homie and is so supportive. And one of the biggest reasons
[38:55] that I've been able to do what I do and he's been sick for a while.
[38:59] So please everyone, you know, send him some love, goodbyes, that kind of thing,
[39:04] because Homie's been sick for a while and we miss him. And thank you for saying hi, go take care of yourself.
[39:12] We will be around. We will not fall off the edge of the world.
[39:16] - Totally. And as you get better, you hit that point of lockdown
[39:19] where it's more boredom than sickness, let me know. I'm like working on all this code stuff.
[39:23] So if you just wanna chill on Zoom as I code, hit me up, Homie.
[39:27] But yeah, no, for real y'all, the new COVID variant, like as aid workers, we're COVID responsible
[39:34] and it's not good, man. The new one is not good.
[39:38] So now's the time if you're in a cab or an Uber or on a bus or, you know, whatever, like mask up when you can,
[39:46] get the booster, the biannual booster. If anyone wants 200,000 masks,
[39:54] I got them in a warehouse in Germany and I can probably ship them to you for free.
[39:58] So if you know what to do with that, but seriously, like take care of yourselves, right?
[40:03] The world needs us happy and healthy so that we can take care of each other.
[40:08] But Homie, get better. - All the best.
[40:11] - Yes, yes. And thank you, please continue.
[40:14] I just really wanted to take that opportunity. - Yeah, anyways, point being like,
[40:20] so we have this needs assessment tool, we have the data groups have been participating.
[40:24] This empowers the people that fill out this survey to take action, to send this to their supporters.
[40:30] And Ramon, you're exactly right. That link right there encodes all those filters
[40:34] into the URL so that if you copy and paste it, like if you share it on Facebook, whatever,
[40:40] you know, it'll take people back to the graph you were viewing.
[40:43] - That didn't work because probably something I did with, maybe it's just like difficult with Gitpod
[40:54] to get that to work. - I'm not sure, yeah.
[40:59] - 8,000, gitpod.io/ - We can send you the Netlify branch preview.
[41:05] Will you try it out there? - Yeah, sounds good.
[41:09] I do wonder what happened though. Oh, no, wait.
[41:12] Ah, that'll do it. - We'll find out.
[41:16] - That'll do it. Come back, Gitpod.
[41:18] Yep. That's my bad.
[41:26] - Yeah, we got a comment here. I'm not sure how to share them,
[41:29] but Building Bedrock says, "I can irresponsibly use 200 masks,
[41:34] but they should use for what they're intended." So these are cloth masks.
[41:37] Unfortunately, we're having a hard time placing them. So they really are just up for grabs,
[41:42] but the minimum order size for them is gonna probably be a full 40 foot container.
[41:47] I can't break them down smaller than that. Maybe a pallet of like 10,000 at a time
[41:52] is kind of the scale that we operate at. - Whew, yeah, fair.
[41:58] - So somebody has to have a garage or something to put it somewhere, 'cause I'm guessing-
[42:06] - I want you to probably have a warehouse that a truck can back up to is the real answer there.
[42:12] - I was just gonna say, it's not gonna fit through your front door.
[42:16] - No, no. That's actually a big part of our U.S. strategy right now,
[42:21] though, is we've just started a hubs working group. We have four different cities
[42:26] where people are setting up their own aid wiring hubs as we've been like talking to them
[42:30] for a few months about this. So really excited.
[42:33] And that's kind of the point of what we do. We do a lot of this bundling
[42:36] to help these really grassroots community-driven groups work together to interact
[42:42] with the big complicated global supply chain in an economically efficient manner, right?
[42:47] So if you do just have a garage, you need to call your local hub
[42:51] who has that warehouse that we can back the truck out to, and you can reserve your pallet off of it.
[42:56] If you have a small community distro, if you wanna stock up to take care of your employees,
[43:01] like whatever it is, right? That's kind of our strategy.
[43:06] How do we break this like very large scale aid stuff down into something that you as an individual
[43:12] or a group of friends or a community or can manage? - Love it. - Yeah, working Ramon?
[43:19] - Everything's working again. So now I took the link.
[43:23] There we go. My new tab, put it in, and there we go.
[43:29] Sort of item grease, and these are re-shareable, and I like that the colors are randomized, by the way.
[43:35] - Thanks, yeah, I've been kind of like trying to just get like basic design stuff,
[43:40] so just on the background of different things, like the background changes,
[43:43] and I just kind of took the lighter swaths of our color scheme,
[43:49] and have like a little background color randomizer, bar chart color randomizer,
[43:56] so that I didn't have to make decisions. I'm just like, a designer made this decision,
[43:59] on what the colors are, and it'll be assigned randomly, and I'll be okay with that, and I can move on.
[44:05] - Love it, love it. Cool, so we got some time left,
[44:10] and I don't wanna miss out. I don't wanna deprive us of like planning this,
[44:14] or like talking about this contributor program. - I did get excited about Jen's idea
[44:25] of having the arrows next to the title. Jen, what do you think?
[44:29] Do you wanna try and put this in? You can drive, we can navigate.
[44:37] - I just wanted to give you pretty things. I mean, you can do it.
[44:42] I just wanna make pretty things. I say that, but I mean, I do,
[44:45] but I honestly just, look. - I don't control.
[44:49] - Hey, Ramon, why don't you drive, and Jen can navigate, like on the like, what to do,
[44:54] and I can navigate on the like, where does this live in the code base?
[44:57] - Cool. - Okay, okay.
[44:59] - We can do that. We get a contribution.
[45:01] By the way, I learned how to do like a co-authored commits, so you will get a green square.
[45:07] - I always feel bad when I rebase other people's work, and it adds me as a co-author,
[45:11] and I'm like, no, I just rebased it. It's okay.
[45:14] - That said, rebasing is work. - That's true.
[45:17] It is like, that's the maintainer thing. - Okay, so we are looking at, I'm excited.
[45:23] - Really quick, I just wanna like think this through as the process is, so that graphic already exists somewhere,
[45:32] so would it be, I would, well, Ramon's driving, but like the process would be going and finding that graphic
[45:42] and then adding it on each side of the text, or would it have to be, well, I was wondering,
[45:50] does it have to be like an upload to an icon to be able to use that way?
[45:58] - So the way I would find this out, oh, sorry. - No, no, I love it.
[46:01] I want you all to discover it, actually. I'm not gonna-- - True.
[46:05] Like, Jen, you and I have zero like insight into this, so this is like you and me discovering.
[46:11] I love this. So the way I would find out if this is like an icon
[46:14] from like an icon pack or something is I would inspect this element using my browser,
[46:18] and if you see here, we've got span class relative, da-da-da-da-da, and there you see there's the icon,
[46:25] so it is an HTML character. - Yes, that's so much easier to do.
[46:30] - Right? So we can take this. - That's all.
[46:33] - No, no, direct me, direct me. You're the boss here.
[46:36] - Well, because we would have to do it for every page, though.
[46:41] - Mm-hmm. - Maybe.
[46:44] How would you do it for each of the-- - Well, it depends on how it's coded up,
[46:50] and so the question is did I handcraft all of those different pages,
[46:55] or is there like a template or something there where you just have to change it one spot?
[47:00] - My thought process is you would have done a template or what Bedrock said, a component,
[47:10] because back in the day, you were trying to, we were trying to do templates of something,
[47:16] and I fell off the edge of the earth. (laughing)
[47:21] - No, you didn't. You're doing great. - So I would go to the code,
[47:26] what did you call that, Gitpod? - Yep.
[47:30] - Gitpod, and I don't know if I would search. - Let's search it. - Or, oh.
[47:41] See, I would have-- - But it would not be the actual Unicode thing, right?
[47:43] In the code, it's gonna be the HTML kind of like, and whatever, whatever, colon.
[47:50] - Oh, see, I would actually go through the folder structure, because I would wanna know how it's linked together.
[47:58] - Folks, by the way, sorry to interrupt you, Jen. As always, let us know if the font size is too small.
[48:05] All you gotta do is let us know and we'll make it bigger. Carry on, Jen.
[48:10] - Can I make a recommendation here real quick? On the GitHub PR, we got the CodeSea review maps integrated.
[48:18] So that'll show you which files I've changed, right? And you can kinda use that,
[48:23] rather than exploring the whole code-based structure, like, what's a reasonable place for this thing to live,
[48:29] right, can we shortcut our way to where this is? - Good call.
[48:33] So our sponsors, CodeSea is kindly sponsoring our streams and our further development.
[48:42] So here we can get a visualization of which files have changed.
[48:46] - Yes, and this always makes me confused, because I'm still working on learning
[48:53] like the how to go look for stuff. So I'm always like, visualization now, what?
[49:01] But I'm normally such a visual person that this would be really helpful.
[49:05] - Yeah, and this is such a large PR that it's like maybe less helpful
[49:10] than the usual like kind of smaller modular PRs that we do, 'cause this is integrating a lot of stuff.
[49:16] - But I think we can work our way, 'cause like building bedrock layout says very correctly,
[49:20] start with pages and work your way down. Yeah, so we've got our pages here for the regions,
[49:26] and each, so we were looking at a sub-region page. So if we take a look here,
[49:30] we can see which ones are being, what is being used here. Block links list, section grid, Gatsby image.
[49:38] I'm just gonna like poke around and see what I find. - I'm having to look.
[49:42] Oh, so it does actually give full. I always thought it just gave like what the file was,
[49:48] not that it- - If you double click on it, it'll show you the code diff.
[49:55] - Yeah, that's what I was looking at. - This is what we use all the time.
[49:58] Like if I'm reviewing someone's PR, I don't use the GitHub interface.
[50:01] I go straight to CodeSee. I kind of use the visualization to build my mental model
[50:06] and then step through the review, looking at like the line-by-line diff, file-by-file.
[50:12] Does it, it's not just like, here's a bunch of files you got to sort through.
[50:15] It's like, oh, I can start just like Bedrock said, like, let me start with the page.
[50:18] Then we'll look at the component the page uses and kind of mark them off as I go.
[50:22] - So then we would take the 1000, yeah. And then we would put that on either side of the class.
[50:34] Yeah, that. - Yep, you read my mind.
[50:36] So we got to go to da-subregion.slug. So do I-
[50:40] - So it won't let you change it there. You can only view it there?
[50:43] - Yeah, that's more of like the review interface. If you want to make changes, you got to, you know,
[50:48] have it in your editor, have it on Gitpod or something like that.
[50:52] - Can it open from CodeSee to Gitpod for the accurate, so you don't have to go search for the file again?
[51:00] - No, but that's going to be our streams once a week feature requests.
[51:05] CodeSee team, if you're watching this, I want to be able to click on a Gitpod button right here
[51:10] to open the PR and yeah. - That'd be really cool.
[51:15] - I dig it, I dig it. We will give random feedback.
[51:19] - I'm excited. - So once the Eric Simmons company is doing something cool
[51:24] that kind of does that, it'll put it in GitHub. So it'll like add a comment,
[51:28] just like CodeSee adds the comment with the map. It'll add a comment to a dev environment.
[51:32] So you can just like click the button and kind of check out the PR and it's like up and running.
[51:39] Let me see if I can find it real quick. - I do not know that, but that sounds really helpful.
[51:44] - I know, it seems like a pod, but it actually gets to that level of granularity.
[51:50] So y'all keep doing the code stuff and let me see if I can't come up with-
[51:54] - Yeah, totally. Okay, Jen, so I've done what you instructed,
[51:59] but it looks, cannot read properties of null reading, remove child.
[52:03] I probably just have to refresh. Hey, okay.
[52:07] Well, okay. We did take an icon and put it on either side.
[52:13] (laughing) - Wrong line.
[52:16] - Yeah, but hey, we're on the right track. That's a win.
[52:20] A win is a win. 95, this looks like the right one.
[52:25] What do you think? Yeah.
[52:28] - Well, can we copy and paste it into the Googles to verify?
[52:33] - Oh, that's a good call. Let's do that.
[52:34] Downward two headed arrow. That's the one.
[52:38] - Yay. That way, because I would end up doing it
[52:41] where it would end up like fixing it every time and then getting really annoyed and going, oh, wait.
[52:48] - Probably looking better. The other thing you did that I noticed
[52:52] is that you centered it. - Oh, I did center it, yes.
[52:56] - Which- - I'm not as concerned about the centering
[53:00] as much as just making sure that they were on both sides and I didn't have room with the way it previously was.
[53:09] So I ended up just centering it because of that, but centering it may look better.
[53:15] You're right. - Exactly.
[53:19] So we can give it a try. Let me, what about spacing?
[53:25] Building better. So it says, what about spacing?
[53:27] Should it be bigger? The title or the icons?
[53:30] - I personally like the icons. The only thing that I think we should change here
[53:36] is in the menu itself by regions is putting a space between all regions and the arrow.
[53:45] - Oh, each region and its respective arrow. - Yeah, because it's bugging me.
[53:53] I don't have a, I feel like this is going to be like me
[53:55] trying to explain things. I was like, I don't know.
[53:57] It's just bugging me. That's not a really good reason why.
[54:01] - Probably be here. Right, Taylor?
[54:06] That would probably be here for each arrow per little ML. - Between the, oh, and between the icons and heading.
[54:13] - Yeah, yeah. The other thing you could do
[54:16] is you could move the span there outside and put it in the kind of parent flex box
[54:23] so that it has the same gap between the arrow as the text. - Oh, I did that.
[54:29] - So you can do it either way. - Okay, cool.
[54:35] That the prettier will do its thing. - Yeah, yeah.
[54:39] - We need this div? - Probably not, no.
[54:45] I was probably just putting a div in there to have a div in there.
[54:48] I didn't have it on the other one. So clearly there was some copy and paste shenanigans
[54:52] going on. - Yeah, that looks spacier.
[55:01] - I do like the space here. Can we make the menu one icon bigger?
[55:07] - This one? - Yeah.
[55:09] - Hard to select. Yes, let's do that.
[55:11] - When I originally designed it, it's not shown up in your browser, Ramon,
[55:13] but you see that top, negative top, negative four. I was trying to have that arrow intersect
[55:18] with the HR there so that it would be coming down, but be attached to that kind of horizontal line.
[55:26] So make it a thing that might create that effect. I don't know if that effect is helpful.
[55:31] - It is a helpful effect. I think this is going to be tricky to achieve
[55:36] across different operating systems and browsers. - Yeah, it seems like a very hacky solution.
[55:42] So is that going to be a natural graphic or something? I don't know.
[55:45] - I do dig me a good hacky solution. But yeah, let's text four Excel.
[55:55] All right, let's make this six Excel. Too big.
[56:03] - Five. - Do five.
[56:06] Didn't know five. Ooh.
[56:11] - I like that. And then can we center Slovakia?
[56:15] - Please, yes. - Yep.
[56:17] And then we'll have to do the same for the region one. - Oh, yeah.
[56:20] - The region page. - Yeah, it's kind of like, you know,
[56:23] do things twice and kind of refine them and then make it modular.
[56:26] So I think these region and sub region pages have a lot of overlap,
[56:29] which I need to refactor out into components. - Oh, I'm the same, Taylor.
[56:34] - Or to the audience, if you're excited about coding at distributed,
[56:39] you could refactor them out to the components too. - Absolutely.
[56:46] I need to figure out how to do tech center in Tailwind, unless somebody knows.
[56:51] - I'm not sure it's a tech center thing. It might be a Flexbox thing, right?
[56:54] 'Cause I'm using like stacks of Flexboxes. So it might be...
[56:58] - Yeah. - I don't know if that HR or if the heading
[57:01] goes all the way across or if it gets kind of scaled down
[57:04] and to make it left aligned. - Yeah, good call, good call.
[57:08] - Does it fill out? - I need to get out of mobile view.
[57:11] There we go. Yeah, see, it doesn't go all the way.
[57:15] - Yeah, to get the HR effect there, I have that 20% larger.
[57:21] You see that width six slash fifths. So I kind of intentionally was having it stick out the end.
[57:27] What you could do is maybe like, not have it do that or something,
[57:31] but then it might cut off too close to the arrows. You could also have left padding
[57:35] to the title and the subtitle to kind of like, do like, yeah, you can do some positioning stuff.
[57:42] - I just committed a crime, I think. - Oh, I love it.
[57:45] Oh, yay. (laughing)
[57:48] It's so easy. - See, this is what happens
[57:51] when you get a lazy developer on stream. (laughing)
[57:56] - So what we did... - Make it the same size, et cetera, done.
[57:58] - Listen, if we're gonna use a hack, we might as well use it again.
[58:02] - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, that works.
[58:05] - Yeah, it's consistency right there. - See, after my own heart, Taylor.
[58:10] Exactly, consistency. Cool, so I think that's established as working.
[58:17] What we can do now is just take this change and move it over to the other region page
[58:25] and then do all of that, commit it, and then take a look at the program.
[58:34] Sound good? - Yeah, that sounds great.
[58:37] - Jen, you good with that too? - Yeah.
[58:39] - Fabulous, so that's... - Is this page public right now?
[58:45] - It's publicly available in some form. Like, if you go to distribute.org/regions,
[58:53] it's there, all the data and everything is on it publicly, but we haven't launched the page yet,
[58:58] so it's not on our production. Like, you won't see regions or needs on our production site.
[59:03] - Perfect. - Yeah, this is to get it up there
[59:05] and have the menu items be accessible and stuff. - Perfect, that is what I needed to know.
[59:11] - Yeah. What am I doing here?
[59:17] This is the arrow, we wanted to make this text five Excel. And we've got the bigger thans that need to be spaced out.
[59:28] What to do. I think, did I get it?
[59:33] - Other direction there, you want that one to go above, right?
[59:37] So you want to move it outside that class flex. There you go.
[59:40] And you can just get rid of the extraneous div. - Oh yeah, big fan of deleting divs.
[59:47] - Yes. Yeah, I went through so many like different iterations
[59:51] on this style that I just had like extra elements lying around that I was like copy and pasting around.
[59:56] - Jen and chat, thoughts? - What?
[60:03] - What do you think? This is the region page now.
[60:07] Based on your new and improved design. - I like it.
[60:13] Now I have something else I don't like. - What's that?
[60:17] That's what we're doing this for. - The and.
[60:22] - The ampersand? - Yeah.
[60:26] - I think that's an easy fix, right? - Yeah.
[60:29] - Oxford comma separator. Is that something you made?
[60:35] - I wrote a little utility. - I love it.
[60:39] - So we could have a strict comma separator or something. If you go to source/utils,
[60:45] I think there's a one function string utils file there. - I mean, that's what holding command
[60:52] and clicking on it is for, it takes us here. - I use sublime text still, okay?
[60:56] I'm old school. - Hey, listen, I'm still using Vim.
[60:59] I don't have much of an argument. I don't have a foot to stand on here.
[61:04] So I think what we can do, right, is just take this, our own, call it strict comma separator.
[61:11] - Or just comma separator or whatever. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[61:15] Get comma separator. And well, building better layout, VS Code all the way.
[61:22] I will not argue with you. VS Code is extremely cool, a tool.
[61:27] I don't think, oh, I see. - You just take out that if else clause, right?
[61:34] If we just remove that clause, it'll repeat everything. Not the first one.
[61:39] - Okay. - No, yeah, and both of them, both of them.
[61:42] Yep, you're right. - Yeah, I think so.
[61:45] There we go. There you go, Jen.
[61:48] I think, I think, get comma separator. Then we need to fix the import.
[61:53] And if I could spell correctly, it wouldn't be almost separator, but comma separator.
[61:59] There we go. There you go.
[62:03] What do you think? - I like it.
[62:06] - Excellent. - It seems like a good stopping point with the code stuff.
[62:11] If we got those-- - Yes.
[62:12] - Between regions and sub regions. - Let's see, GitHub co-author.
[62:18] It's a little bit wordy, but we can do it. Okay, so back here, get status.
[62:25] We will do my favorite patching. So we've replaced the comma separator
[62:30] and we've done our spacing. Yeah.
[62:34] And of course we added status. Okay, that's all.
[62:40] Those are all the changes. Next.
[62:43] Ooh. - Yeah, the TypeScript checks kept failing.
[62:48] So I added them to our pre-commit hook to point out. 'Cause like, they're pretty invisible to me.
[62:54] - Yeah, yeah. - Using sublime text.
[62:56] And I got tired of like pushing commits with a simple TypeScript like issue
[63:00] and then having the depth, like the CI/CD shut me down. So.
[63:05] - Is this a fix? Tweak region and sub region layout.
[63:14] Everything okay? - (laughs) Let's do it.
[63:18] - Look, building bedrock layout. Give us your, give us your, your--
[63:24] - It's a-- - This is--
[63:25] - We can do that, but then we got to add building bedrock to the contributors.
[63:31] - Yeah, totally. - You should, you should.
[63:33] - So hold up. We need, first we need, is your GitHub username Jengenod?
[63:41] - Yes. It took a lot, but yes, it is.
[63:45] - Why did it take a lot? - Because it was under,
[63:49] it was when I first started in the tech world and it was under a work email address.
[63:55] And luckily they still have my email address active. So I had to like sweet talk them
[63:59] into helping me get access. And somehow I still kept the two off on my phone.
[64:07] I swore I deleted it, but I didn't. And so that way y'all know,
[64:14] and I just want to give a shout out to bedrock really quick.
[64:19] - Ramon, when you get a second, can you go to this webpage?
[64:24] 'Cause it's really dope. - Can you please DM,
[64:27] can you please private chat it to me so I can select it? Because otherwise--
[64:31] - Oh yeah, because this is-- - Yeah.
[64:34] - Yeah, StreamYard doesn't like the things. Doesn't like the things.
[64:38] What am I doing? - Gonna need like, building bedrock layout,
[64:42] your call, gonna need either a name or some kind of a thingy.
[64:49] I'm honored to get called-- - So our contributors file of building bedrock layout,
[64:53] it does two things. It means you agree to our kind of fairly standard
[65:00] code of conduct for our tech spaces and things. And there's a link at the top.
[65:04] It also assigns copyright for your contributions to distribute aid as like the steward
[65:08] of this open source project. So we don't end up in a bootstrap situation
[65:12] trying to change a license or something and having to track hundreds of people down.
[65:18] Jen, are you also on the contributors file yet? I thought you were.
[65:24] - I thought so. - You are not, you're not, you're not, you're not.
[65:26] - Oh, I don't think I'm on the contributors side because I'm one of the main team members.
[65:34] - I know. - You guys gave me some fancy stuff.
[65:37] - Yeah, yeah, let's get Jen on there too. - Yeah, totally, totally, totally.
[65:41] - Jen, Jenod. - Yay.
[65:45] - We add full stop, we commit. This is docs, I would say.
[65:52] - I'm sorry, I know it's slow, but. - No, no, no, it's all good.
[65:56] I will, I will check out Bedrock's website in the meantime. - Whoa.
[66:04] - Yeah, so this is like, and Bedrock, we're gonna see if I can explain it
[66:12] because it was a stream a long time ago. - Hold on, let me just switch to English.
[66:17] Oh no, I'm so sorry. There we go.
[66:19] - It's okay. - Don't be sorry, that's awesome, dude.
[66:21] - It's totally cool. So what it is, is like, I've been learning.
[66:26] Okay, hold on. Instead of having to do HTML to CSS,
[66:33] you can do the HTML inside of CSS with Bedrock. Did I say that right, Travis?
[66:42] Maybe, maybe. Something close.
[66:47] It was really cool when you showed it to me. I'm not always.
[66:50] - That's kind of cool, though. Like, can we dive into?
[66:54] - It's really cool. - Oh, I should go grab that stream.
[67:00] - It's both a CSS framework and a React component library. - Oh.
[67:06] - Neat. - Why?
[67:08] I swear I've heard of this before. How new is this project, Bedrock?
[67:15] 'Cause I feel like I've got a friend who brings up a CSS framework all the time,
[67:22] like, new CSS frameworks all the time, and I feel like he's mentioned it to me.
[67:27] Or maybe you've mentioned it, Jen. - Considering I didn't say it very well, maybe I did,
[67:36] but here's the YouTube video of when we streamed, and just looking back at it, it looks,
[67:47] oh my goodness, that was in August. - Yeah, time flies.
[67:51] - It's been that long? Oh my goodness.
[67:54] I don't even, I don't even know. I don't know where time went.
[67:58] I thought it was like a month ago. - So that's done.
[68:02] (silence) - Ah, didn't do it right.
[68:08] - Thanks for the contributions, everybody. - It pushed.
[68:12] Oh, so sorry, Bedrock. Let me bring it up.
[68:15] Oh, let's put it on the left hand so you can see what it does, yeah.
[68:19] Ooh, you've got examples. Ooh, ooh.
[68:23] Oh, neat. So you're like, interesting.
[68:29] So you're like declaring your layout as your markup. Very cool.
[68:35] - That is super cool. - Very cool.
[68:38] Giving me, bringing me back to my bootstrap days. Love it, love it.
[68:44] Thank you so much for building and sharing this. Avatar.
[68:48] - Nice. - I know people that do cool things.
[68:53] - Yeah, for real. - Love it, yeah.
[68:56] - Yeah. I think it would work really well with Tina CMS.
[69:00] So we're kind of going through like a content management system upgrade in February.
[69:07] And Forestry is being depreciated, but the new product that team is building is called Tina.
[69:13] And I think we can unlock like live editor previews. So like if people are adding to or editing,
[69:20] you know, like let's say you're a logistic coordinator updating one of those region pages
[69:23] with new information, right? You can see that like,
[69:26] as you're typing it out in the editor, instead of having to like submit your changes
[69:30] and wait for prod to rebuild. And so, it seems like like given the kind of
[69:36] plug and play nature of what you're building out here with these, you know, styled components, right?
[69:42] Like for that avatar or something, like having Tina CMS hooks into it
[69:47] would provide like a really cool end to end dev experience
[69:51] where you get the content like creation side through that Git-based CMS.
[69:57] I just wanted to like connect those two ideas. - Yeah.
[70:00] - Yeah, you should check them out. - Super cool.
[70:02] Cool, I realize we're running low on time. I do want to finally give us a chance to talk about,
[70:11] you know, our big project. (laughs)
[70:15] Not that this is a small project. - Yeah, but I feel like something that would help,
[70:22] you definitely did not hijack the stream. - You did not, no.
[70:25] - Yeah, no, like I was bringing it up. So, something that I'm curious about on CodeZ
[70:33] is have you ever used the tool Miro, like a Miro board? - Yes, well, I mean, I've heard of it, I haven't used it.
[70:44] - I'm wondering if CodeZ has any tool like that so we wouldn't have to add a tool to our tech stack.
[70:52] - So like the ability to draw our visualizations. - Yeah, like a brainstorming board or because-
[71:01] - No. - No.
[71:03] - I know this has been requested, like full disclosure, I used to work at CodeZ.
[71:08] I think there were either. There were discussions and definitely requests.
[71:13] I'm not going to say definitively whether they were planning on working on it or not,
[71:17] but like being able to draft out maps collaboratively is something that has been requested.
[71:23] - Okay. - Right, so kind of like if you want to like,
[71:26] that's interesting. Yeah, so CodeZ, like you can just get a code-based map
[71:29] and you can like comment on it and you can label different files and things like that.
[71:33] You can set up tours if you want, where you like walk people through,
[71:37] but that sounds different than what you're talking about, Jim.
[71:41] - Yeah, for like planning out future, like new files, new organization methods.
[71:45] I said, I think this is something that has been requested. - Okay, then what I would suggest we do,
[71:53] because I do want to go into the planning aspect of it, but I personally think just getting in my head
[72:00] the tech stack, so that way I don't have to like do stuff and then try to remember to move the stuff
[72:11] to the what we decide to do, because to be honest, I'll forget.
[72:16] And if I write it down, I will write it down. And then I may forget to put it on the other thing.
[72:22] Just because I think that would be really good for the visualization and also with next steps.
[72:31] - Yeah. - Does DistributeAid so far use any Kanban boards
[72:38] or anything like Notion or Airtable? - Yeah, so we have a Notion and I can get that.
[72:45] I can get you access to that, Jen. And we can probably set up a space on there.
[72:50] If we want to kind of open that up to the DA dev community, we can have a subsection.
[72:57] For stuff like that, and same thing with our Slack, it's a little bit in the bubble
[73:02] because we have a lot of operational details there. So we just need to create structured access for,
[73:10] okay, here's the tech space and that's safe for everyone working on tech projects and some of the aid stuff
[73:15] or like where like, I don't know, we deliver aid to safe houses sometimes,
[73:19] like not everyone needs that address, right? - Exactly, exactly.
[73:24] I'm just thinking that would be a little easier to at least get something started from
[73:31] and knowing where that's gonna go to be able to build upon. So if I could get that, but, and I'm waiting,
[73:40] I'm purposely waiting to ask about more details and the vision until those are set up,
[73:46] because I use Miro a lot in the fact of, it's very visual for me.
[73:51] I can be like, okay, cool, like you're saying that this is the core thing we need to do.
[73:57] I can do a squiggly line over here that points to some other things.
[74:01] And I think that would be cool to showcase. And something that I think would be really cool for us
[74:08] since we're starting to do these Thursdays is, just choosing what we're gonna do on the Thursday.
[74:14] I love that you guys were doing the code stuff today because I was like, cool, I could do other stuff
[74:20] and hang out and still contribute. But it wasn't using full mental effort,
[74:26] I guess is a good way of saying it. I don't know if that makes any sense to the chat.
[74:32] - No, totally, it's easy to like pick up and play, right? And like jump in and make a contribution.
[74:37] And yeah, no, I thought today was a really good stream, but I hear you.
[74:41] Let me, I probably, and I'll reach out after the stream, but we need to do some like DA volunteer onboarding stuff
[74:47] and get you access to some of the existing tools and spaces. And then if you want to use additional tools,
[74:53] that's very easy. The only, like you can use the tools you need to do
[74:57] to run this project. And if it costs money, just check in with me
[75:02] so I can see if there's like a grant or something. We usually try to reach out to people
[75:06] and get like a free account or like a free kind of paid, whatever the paid plan is because of the work that we do.
[75:14] So when I kind of go through the process for that, but yeah, like this is exactly why I'm excited
[75:20] to work with you. It's like, you know, these tools you, you, you know,
[75:23] like, like have this kind of like already like, you know what to do.
[75:27] So want to, want to be supportive of that direction you want to take it in.
[75:31] - And the more perspectives, the better. - Yeah.
[75:35] - And I'm excited for this. And I personally think that it's cool to see everything
[75:42] that we did today and something that I love about open source and Bedrock has done this before too,
[75:51] especially when I was such a new of, you don't have to be a coder to contribute to open source.
[76:01] Like everything I did today was talking about, I want to make things pretty.
[76:05] Like this is a design thing that is bugging the shit out of me.
[76:08] And this is stuff that, you know, you can learning how to use GitHub,
[76:15] you can create these type of, you know, issues or submit for these.
[76:24] It's something that I first did with when I was really scared of it, I did with Bedrock and it's,
[76:31] it makes it so much more accessible to those who don't want to learn how to code.
[76:36] It's just learning the tools. So I'm very excited to show this.
[76:41] - May I be a little bit cheeky and plug a talk I've given last year?
[76:46] - Please. - Only if you link it.
[76:49] - Of course I'm going to link it. How would people watch it otherwise?
[76:53] So at Codeline last year, I gave a talk titled, there's more to open source than code.
[77:02] And it is exactly about not only what my journey into open source was like, which was not by coding because I was
[77:09] terrified of making code contributions because I was like, what if I make a giant PR and I discovered that someone's
[77:15] already made it or what if I try and claim an issue and someone's like, hey, you can't do that.
[77:20] So my approach was to start talking to people like you, like, like you Jen, just talking to people and being like,
[77:27] hey, what are we all doing? How can I help?
[77:29] Here's some insights from me and so on and so forth. - It is terrifying.
[77:34] I will say that because I think everybody's going to be really mean.
[77:39] I'm just going to mess it up and they're going to make fun of me.
[77:43] Ooh, that was some pretty colors, but yeah, is everybody's normally really kind and we'll show you how
[77:52] to do it and you, you need practice. It'll take a few times.
[77:57] It's not something that magically happens. - That's what I love about what we're doing here, right?
[78:03] I feel like I, like a couple of people I've talked to about like the DA, you know, like our contributors,
[78:09] we're just catching up at a code jam or something. And I think that we facilitate like a really safe and
[78:15] positive and encouraging space, right? Cause we're just like happy to move the aid and like whoever
[78:19] wants to contribute to the thing we're doing is welcome. But I hear you on that structure side, Jen,
[78:26] like people do need time to, you gotta start off somewhere. And so, you know, like giving people a structured pathway
[78:34] through that kind of early stage open source journey, I'm excited to build that out with you.
[78:38] And then also specifically recognizing what you're saying about non-code contributors.
[78:43] I know Ramon talks about this a fair bit on stream and a large part of what we do is like,
[78:48] we're building tech to enable non-tech contributors, right? Like all of the data is gathered by logistics coordinators,
[78:54] all the contents written by our admins, right? You know, and so I view part of the point of contributing
[79:01] technically is, you know, to enable those folks to contribute non-technically,
[79:07] but there's definitely, you know, this kind of maintainer side or, you know, testing side,
[79:13] there's so many different tracks you can go down, you know, that's like a very valid, very necessary contribution.
[79:21] So excited to set those tracks up through our dev champions program as well.
[79:27] - And you know, I think, and I think by just like poking around and testing around,
[79:31] this is something we try to do very, very much with DistributeAid is emphasize that we are here
[79:37] to help you. And this is something that, and I'm just going to,
[79:40] I know we didn't get to do it today and I apologize. This is something we,
[79:46] the exact kind of thing that we want to enable with DistributeAid, which is,
[79:51] this is something we started drafting with Taylor. And this is something that we want Jen,
[79:57] well, that Jen is going to very kindly help us with by taking lead on the contributor program.
[80:07] Building out, one thing that I've been seeing, I don't want to get on too much of a soapbox here myself,
[80:11] but one thing that I've been seeing a lot in the last- - Soapbox!
[80:13] - I'll try, I'll try, I'll try to be gentle. One thing that I've been seeing a lot in the last year
[80:20] or so of being very online trademark is that a lot of people want to get an open source,
[80:27] but that onboarding point is tricky. And finding a project is tricky.
[80:34] And finding a project, because at the same time, maintainers are human beings.
[80:39] Maintainers have lives they need to cater to. Maintainers can only do good open source
[80:44] if they are able to do it both health-wise, resource-wise. So leaning on maintainers to do all of the legwork
[80:54] of that maintainership is difficult. So what can we do as maintainers best
[81:00] in order to have more maintainers, have fellow contributors and all of that
[81:05] is to make that on-ramping easier. And this is exactly what we're aiming with,
[81:12] with the Distribute Aid program. - Indeed. - Did you say Aid?
[81:19] - That's the working title, by the way, Jen. We're open to change here.
[81:24] I think there's even an issue, or a discussion about it. - Yeah. - But the working title
[81:29] is actually for developers, a little bit of, you know, like- - It's, yeah.
[81:36] I've mentioned it to people and it's- - It's a work in progress.
[81:40] - I'm gonna noodle on it. I'm gonna noodle on it. - Okay, okay.
[81:43] - I mean, one of the most classic paradigms of programming is, what is it?
[81:47] The hardest things in programming are naming. And what else?
[81:51] - Regex, probably. - And regular expressions. I like regular expressions,
[81:57] but I understand- - I love them, yes. - Yeah, but there's also a GitHub discussion.
[82:01] And this is the thing, like, I can't think of many open-source champion programs,
[82:08] like champions that are built in public. This is why I'm so excited about this.
[82:13] And this is why I invite all of you. I'm just throwing links into the chat.
[82:17] There's a discussion. - Yeah, no, it's really, to everyone watching right now,
[82:22] like, we're building this for y'all. Like, I'm trying to, you know, like the point of this is,
[82:27] like, what would make it exciting and interesting and supported to contribute, you know,
[82:32] to open-source projects and specifically, you know, distribute aids open-source projects,
[82:37] but by building it in public, right? Like, it's a great way for us, just like our different,
[82:42] you know, like trucking and other sort of resource guides, like anyone can pick this up and apply them
[82:47] to their open-source stuff, right? And make it easier to get people involved there, right?
[82:52] And give people, you know, structure, give them validation, you know, let them use this as a stepping stone
[82:57] in their own career journey, right? Like, yeah.
[83:00] - Exactly, so there's a discussion, come in, contribute. We want to hear from y'all.
[83:06] Like, what can we do? And this is because what we ultimately want to do
[83:10] is have some kind of, for lack of a better term, brand recognition that you can bring in,
[83:16] that you can bring in to say, when you're looking for your first tech role,
[83:20] that you can say, hey, and again, name is not final. I'm a distribute aid.
[83:26] What can I bring, like, and have that sort of be like, oh, wow, this is somebody who's, just like people,
[83:34] and you saw here previously, sorry. I know I'm taking us a little bit over time.
[83:37] I don't want to keep everybody. - I love how excited you are, though, right?
[83:40] I'm like, keep it going. - This stuff gets me fired up.
[83:43] This stuff gets me real fired up because this is an opportunity for us as a community
[83:48] to build up our, again, for lack of a better term, prestige. - No, and I feel you.
[83:53] Like, on the soapbox, I think it's very common and kind of problematic, right?
[83:59] Like, the randomness of which open source projects will take off, but it's like, okay.
[84:04] Like, when it does, there's tons of people that contribute to all these big open source projects,
[84:11] but it's usually, like, the team that was at, you know, Facebook that started React, right?
[84:16] Those are the people that get the recognition. You know, those are the people
[84:19] whose career trajectories get changed. I'm like, but wait a minute.
[84:22] Like, we're all, like, contributing to React in different ways and writing documentation
[84:27] and, you know, teaching courses. I know you do a lot of, like, coding bootcamp stuff, Ramon,
[84:32] and so I think by, you know, trying to develop some structure,
[84:36] but have a thing, right? Have a thing that you can talk about
[84:40] that hopefully people, like you said, they're like, oh, you went through this program.
[84:45] I know what that means. You know, that's a way where it's not just, like,
[84:49] the Taylor Show or the Ramon Show or the Jen Show. Like, oh, we did Tech Ideas.
[84:52] Like, no, I went through the program. I made my contributions.
[84:55] I helped get that aid moved, right? And, like, take that to people.
[84:58] Like, get your worth out of your open source contributions, you know?
[85:03] - At the risk of sounding corny, you know, people are, I'm sorry.
[85:10] People power open source. Why not use open source to empower people?
[85:15] - I love it. I love it. That's our tagline right there.
[85:18] - I'm a big cheese ball, and I don't deny it. It's fine.
[85:21] Folks, we've had you on for so long. I'm so thankful, and I'm so sorry to take us over time.
[85:27] Jen, thank you so much for joining us and for, you know, being here to kick off 2023 with us.
[85:33] I'm so excited. I think what we're building here,
[85:37] not only the website, but also this contributorship program,
[85:40] it's just gonna be huge. - It is.
[85:46] - And I, yeah, I think this is gonna bring great things. Yeah, well, hope-
[85:53] - On that note, hold on. I got a raid to somebody.
[85:56] Let's- - Oh, yeah. Let's do the raiding. - You gotta pass the raids.
[85:58] Gotta pass the raids, because- - I don't do this any, like, I've never done this.
[86:01] So, like- - I don't understand Twitch. - So, what's gonna happen now, Taylor,
[86:07] in case you're curious, is Jen is gonna find somebody who's streaming
[86:10] and send all of our viewers all the way to them. - That's why Jason's ended up coming over here,
[86:17] is he found somebody that was streaming, and he's a rock star.
[86:21] So, but I need to actually find somebody that's streaming that's not the three of us that I follow.
[86:27] Like, it'll show you- - For the convergence point. - Yeah, so- - Don't know this person,
[86:34] but Bedrock says this person's available. - Oh, okay.
[86:38] Thank you. Yay.
[86:44] Why am I not following you? Hello.
[86:49] Okay. And stream, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid.
[86:54] - Are we doing the raid? - Yeah, you have to do it from Twitch,
[87:05] you can't do it from- - Oh, okay. - Which is really annoying.
[87:09] In case anybody was curious, it's not an easy process,
[87:14] but they're getting raided now. Bye.
[87:17] - Bye, everybody. - Peace out, y'all.
