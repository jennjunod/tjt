[00:00] I was like, be part of the community that shares kind of your beliefs and your goals.
[00:09] So I started hanging out with Jacob's Twitter spaces and I liked a lot of the content that was being discussed.
[00:15] And then I started coming up and speaking and that's how Jacob and Theo
[00:18] and other people got to know me. And the key there is that like, I wasn't messaging Theo,
[00:24] I wasn't messaging Jacob and asking them for a bunch of help. I was speaking in Twitter spaces,
[00:31] having conversations with them and other people and they got to know me that way.
[00:36] And then when I did ask any questions specific to them, they knew who I was, which is huge.
[00:43] They interacted with me and like, it was more than just like, yes, I've seen his name there.
[00:48] They've actually like, they can, you know, think of my voice so they remember type of conversations,
[00:52] whatever the case is. But more importantly, they know like,
[00:56] and have a rough idea of what my abilities.
