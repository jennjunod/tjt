[00:05] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[00:24] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[00:32] - What up? I'm working on my presentation.
[01:02] And like, I now know what I'm going to be doing for the presentation.
[01:07] Thank you, Anthony. But I haven't actually put it on paper yet.
[01:11] So that's what I'm here to do. It's going to be exciting.
[01:16] (upbeat music) We're going to leave like half of this.
[01:28] I don't like this. Nice.
[01:36] I'm jealous. What are you getting?
[01:38] Cooked bread and co? I've never, I never knew that.
[01:46] I thought it was always called the same thing everywhere. Do not get their energy water or like energy lemonade.
[01:54] Like, it'll make you feel like you're having a heart attack. It has way more caffeine than like any energy drink.
[02:01] It's crazy. Dude, I'm so jealous.
[02:06] Their chicken Asian salad is so yummy. It's so yummy.
[02:12] I suggest that for everybody. Oh.
[02:20] (upbeat music) Oh.
[02:29] Well, okay. That's, that's, that makes sense.
[02:35] (upbeat music) (indistinct)
[02:40] Well, she is a smart cookie. Are you getting her lunch?
[02:53] I hope you're getting her lunch too. Or she's with you.
[03:00] Or you're at least getting her lunch. (upbeat music)
[03:04] (upbeat music) Just making sure.
[03:16] (upbeat music) (indistinct)
[03:24] Oh yeah, that does make sense too. Okay.
[03:36] When you do presentations with code examples, it's just viewing the code, right?
[03:43] They're not like, I don't know, because I'm thinking that maybe I should create
[03:50] a new repo for it for the examples and include that. I don't know.
[03:56] It is not solidly thought through yet. As to me just doing it now
[04:02] and not being able to think it through. So I'm doing it.
[04:06] So I get it done. (upbeat music)
[04:11] (indistinct) Yeah.
[04:27] They said I definitely don't need to code on the spot, but I'm just thinking if they wanted to look at my examples.
[04:32] But... (upbeat music)
[04:35] Yeah. I don't know if they show more like the code differences.
[04:44] Bakari, I promise I will look at your stuff later today too. Okay.
[04:52] When is your interview, Bakari? 'Cause I've been like,
[04:58] I don't know if this happens to anybody else, but like I've been so like stuck on this presentation
[05:03] that I'm like, I really need to get started. That's taken up my last last three days,
[05:09] but I haven't gotten started 'cause I'm like, I don't know.
[05:12] Yeah, I don't know. (upbeat music)
[05:16] Okay, cool, cool, cool. (upbeat music)
[05:26] (indistinct) In case anybody is curious,
[05:33] I saw Rizal using this theme on one of her streams. And I was like, I need this.
[05:41] This is my life. It's so fun.
[05:43] So I just like changed the colors of it. It is the fun part about Canva
[05:48] is you can do that very easily. (indistinct)
[05:52] (upbeat music) The old thing we learned in school is how to,
[06:07] yeah, yeah. How to procrastinate is a hundred percent something
[06:11] I feel like I definitely learned in school. (upbeat music)
[06:16] But at least now there's, you know, more, I say more help getting there
[06:22] because I'm like, yay, yay. I can hang out with people while I'm working.
[06:27] So, I need to move all these down. (upbeat music)
[06:35] It's the only thing too, but it's like the one thing, one and only.
[06:49] (upbeat music) Move these down so I can compare.
[06:57] It didn't group again. What is with my grouping skills?
[07:02] We're struggling. (upbeat music)
[07:05] Oh, ungroup. (upbeat music)
[07:14] Ungroup. (upbeat music)
[07:17] Group. (upbeat music)
[07:19] Okay, thank you. (upbeat music)
[07:23] What do you guys build your presentations in? Do you guys use Canva or Google?
[07:29] Oh, there was one I hadn't heard of. (upbeat music)
[07:35] I don't remember what it's called, which is helpful. Google Slides, yeah.
[07:40] (upbeat music) Keynote.
[07:47] (upbeat music) Anthony, I feel like you're always fancy.
[07:52] Use something fancy. (upbeat music)
[07:56], Bakari, I applied for the high school, (upbeat music)
[08:04] Bakari, I applied for the high graph role. A few people sent it to me
[08:29] and then keynote is, it's the Apple built in thing. Oh, oh my gosh.
[08:42] You would like PowerPoint if I can even talk. (upbeat music)
[08:49] I need. (upbeat music)
[08:52] Okay. (upbeat music)
[09:08] Things I learned about. (upbeat music)
[09:12] I'm not gonna worry about spelling at the moment. (upbeat music)
[09:19] Probably not lined up. (upbeat music)
[09:40] It don't look lined up. (upbeat music)
[09:44] It's controlling its own movements. (upbeat music)
[09:52] And I think this can be. (upbeat music)
[10:00] What else did I learn about? (upbeat music)
[10:06] It's actually helpful. (upbeat music)
[10:10] I don't know. Let's go up in there because I don't remember.
[10:26] (upbeat music) No, yes, yes.
[10:35] Let's do an update. (upbeat music)
[10:38] Thank you. Thank you so much.
[10:40] (upbeat music) I don't know why you will never work.
[10:54] (upbeat music) In case anybody was curious,
[10:59] my code dot still doesn't work. My dot still doesn't work.
[11:06] It won't work. It'll never work is what I've decided.
[11:09] Maybe when I get a new computer. (upbeat music)
[11:13] I'll see if it works. (upbeat music)
[11:17] Hey. (upbeat music)
[11:33] Dude, that would be dope, Ikari. That would be dope.
[11:36] (upbeat music) Nice.
[11:39] I hope so. That would be so cool.
[11:41] (upbeat music) I learned.
[11:47] I don't even know how to, what to call these. Data.
[11:55] (upbeat music) Hmm.
[11:59] Data. (upbeat music)
[12:04] Ooh. (upbeat music)
[12:18] How to build a page. (upbeat music)
[12:27] Hmm. (upbeat music)
[12:31] It won't do that. (upbeat music)
[12:35] Hmm. (upbeat music)
[13:03] Oh, I really, really like Arc. Homie was like, "You gotta use Arc."
[13:09] And Laura's like, "Yup, you gotta use Arc." So I finally got Arc.
[13:14] It's fun. (upbeat music)
[13:17] Let me think about this. (upbeat music)
[13:28]s Hmm.
[13:51] I just need a blank page to write down this idea. (upbeat music)
[13:58] Ooh, that's very little. (upbeat music)
[14:02] Bakari, do you still use Chrome? (upbeat music)
[14:09] Or do you use like Firefox or something? (upbeat music)
[14:14] (mumbles) Hmm.
[14:17] (upbeat music) So.
[14:42] (upbeat music) (mumbles)
[14:47] Pages we have, Arc. (upbeat music)
[14:57] Root. (upbeat music)
[15:00] Trees. (upbeat music)
[15:10] Forks. (upbeat music)
[15:14] Polio. (upbeat music)
[15:18] (laughs) (upbeat music)
[15:22] Ink. (upbeat music)
[15:28] (upbeat music) Out of curiosity, I'm not sure what y'all think,
[15:53] but do you think that when you're thinking about a process that counts as work,
[16:00] 'cause like I've been thinking of this for like two weeks or a week, and I'm like, oh, what am I gonna do it on?
[16:06] How am I gonna do it? And so like actually putting it on paper
[16:11] doesn't take long for me because I'm like, oh, I already have like the majority of it thought out,
[16:17] where, but if like, it only counts as like making the presentation, it'll take me like an hour.
[16:24] So the actual thought process of it is like way longer. (upbeat music)
[16:29] Yeah, but if I don't think about it, I'm not gonna know what to do with it.
[16:35] (upbeat music) But so does it count as like,
[16:38] (upbeat music) oh, that's cool.
[16:43] I like that, Bakari. That's how you approach your musical arrangements.
[16:47] Okay, Anthony, like think of it. Like if you have to make a presentation,
[16:52] does it like, if you're like, I worked X amount of hours on it,
[16:57] would you say it's only the hours? (upbeat music)
[17:03] Okay, I feel like I need to read this one. If you could have written the same thing
[17:07] with 1/10 the thought, then waste of time. It depends on whether you needed it that much time to think.
[17:16] (upbeat music) I don't know if that 100% made sense to me.
[17:24] I mean, it does, but I think for myself, yeah, like if you're thinking about billable hours, yeah.
[17:32] Just like I'm thinking out loud on this, because for like a presentation,
[17:40] a lot of it to me is the thought that goes into it. (upbeat music)
[17:47] But what if you did? (upbeat music)
[17:51] (upbeat music) I guess I'm thinking on this one specifically
[17:59] because for this assignment, they were like, don't spend more than four to six hours
[18:04] on the assignment. And I'm like, I spent a lot more time on that.
[18:07] Building it won't take me that long, but the thinking of it has taught me.
[18:12] It took a very long time. (upbeat music)
[18:19] Oh, that's a good way of saying it. The time it took is the time it took.
[18:25] Whether that was efficient use of time is a different question.
[18:30] That's true. And I think it's also like how everybody like learns
[18:35] or does their thing. (upbeat music)
[18:39] Oh, that's what I meant to do. I meant to do these.
[18:49] (upbeat music) It's supposed to be stream schedule, but whatever.
[19:00] (upbeat music) (laughing)
[19:11] I like that one. What they say doesn't matter.
[19:19] I think it's a stupid thing for jobs to include. Yay, thank you.
[19:23] (upbeat music) Okay, so what went into building each page?
[19:31] And for everybody that has started joining as a heads up, this is me currently just thinking out
[19:40] what I'm putting on here and like actually putting words to it and not the full presentation.
[19:47] It'll be pretty later on. (upbeat music)
[19:51] Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[19:57] (upbeat music) Yeah, that's true.
[20:02] That is true. I agree with that.
[20:05] Like I probably put way more thought into this because I really want the job
[20:09] than I necessarily needed to and overthinking it because that's what I spend a lot of my time doing.
[20:15] I'm like, I can't think of anything. And then for those who don't know,
[20:19] I sent Anthony what the assignment was and he was like, just do it about your website
[20:23] and your process. And I was like, oh, why didn't I think of that?
[20:27] 'Cause it totally makes sense and now I have direction. (upbeat music)
[20:34] Okay, so you have the. (upbeat music)
[20:40] Splash. (upbeat music)
[20:58] Okay. (upbeat music)
[21:01] Like I need to actually like look at this. (upbeat music)
[21:20] (upbeat music) (groans)
[21:31] Oh, it's NPM rammed it. (mumbles)
[21:35] Like, did I mess it up again? (upbeat music)
[21:39] (upbeat music) Ah.
[21:53] (upbeat music) And then we have better.
[21:58] Yes, I'm doing this out of order because we have all of those imported
[22:04] and the CSS, and then we have the components. (upbeat music)
[22:14] I don't want. (mumbles)
[22:17] (upbeat music) Okay.
[22:33] (upbeat music) We have.
[22:45] (upbeat music) There she is.
[22:50] (upbeat music) (laughs)
[23:05] Go eat. Enjoy lunch.
[23:08] (upbeat music) I don't really need these bullet points.
[23:24] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[23:29] I need some arrows. (upbeat music)
[23:57] What is everyone else up to? (upbeat music)
[24:02] You're welcome to lurk or hang out or whatever. This is my fun breakdown of how I built my website
[24:14] and not the code format, which I will get into. (upbeat music)
[24:23] (mumbles) Bigger.
[24:31] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[24:36] Can't open any of the arrows out there. (upbeat music)
[24:58] (upbeat music) Oh, goodness.
[25:15] The dog woke up. Give me a second, y'all.
[25:18] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[25:23] Yay. We'll see if this lasts.
[25:45] (upbeat music) Yeah, these are still too big.
[25:49] (upbeat music) (hums)
[26:17] So the stream was... (upbeat music)
[26:21] You have components of stream, (upbeat music)
[26:32] of stream, (upbeat music)
[26:36] and then this component... (upbeat music)
[26:41] You need it there. (upbeat music)
[26:47] (upbeat music) (mumbles)
[26:52] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[27:19] (mumbles) Folio.
[27:22] (upbeat music) Guess we don't need components.
[27:35] (upbeat music) Folio's gonna take a while.
[27:46] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[27:51] Because you have three components. (upbeat music)
[28:14] Chat. (upbeat music)
[28:18] Oh. (upbeat music)
[28:21] Writing. (upbeat music)
[28:27] Writing. (upbeat music)
[28:34] Speaking. (upbeat music)
[28:37] (mumbles) (upbeat music)
[28:42] There. (upbeat music)
[29:08] This page. (upbeat music)
[29:14] I don't think it has any components. I don't know.
[29:21] I haven't needed to go back to it very much. There's my pages.
[29:24] Pages, pages, pages, pages, pages, pages. Page.
[29:27] (upbeat music) Resume.
[29:29] (upbeat music) Yeah, you were
[29:33] (upbeat music) Oh.
[29:36] (upbeat music) Yeah.
[29:39] HTML. (upbeat music)
[29:40] All the HTML ever. (upbeat music)
[29:45] I'm just gonna say (upbeat music)
[29:47] Greenpeace. (upbeat music)
[29:50] Awesome. HTML.
[29:57] (upbeat music) Okay.
[30:00] (upbeat music) Sweet.
[30:02] That is what went into each. (upbeat music)
[30:06] This is not where it started. (upbeat music)
[30:10] Hmm. (upbeat music)
[30:25] I don't need this. (upbeat music)
[30:28] Hmm. (upbeat music)
[30:32] What did I do first? (upbeat music)
[30:42] I ran it. (mumbles)
[30:53] (upbeat music) soon.
[30:56] (upbeat music) (mumbles)
[31:10] (mumbles) (mumbles)
[31:16] (upbeat music) Okay.
[31:20] (mumbles) Soon.
[31:24] (upbeat music) Words.
[31:32] (upbeat music) (mumbles)
[31:49] (upbeat music) (mumbles)
[31:54] I don't know what it's called. I don't know if that's what it's called.
[32:02] (upbeat music) I think so.
[32:11] I think it is. Where they build the images.
[32:14] Yeah. (upbeat music)
[32:17] Contentful. Okay.
[32:19] So I wanted to use Contentful. (upbeat music)
[32:21] And I wanted to do an Notion API for schedule. (upbeat music)
[32:26] (mumbles) And Notion API for schedule.
[32:31] (upbeat music) Notion API for schedule.
[32:35] (upbeat music) (mumbles)
[32:41] (upbeat music) the next one.
[32:45] (upbeat music) (mumbles)
[32:51] (upbeat music) (mumbles)
[33:15] (upbeat music) Words.
[33:35] (mumbles) (upbeat music)
[33:40] (mumbles) (upbeat music)
[33:44] Hello. I'm still thinking about like my thought process now.
[34:00] How was lunch? I hope it was amazing.
[34:02] I'm very jelly. I want banana.
[34:06] (upbeat music) (mumbles)
[34:10] Okay. Okay.
[34:15] Not bad. (upbeat music)
[34:18] I probably should. I'm not great at doing that.
[34:29] I will eat lunch in an hour and a half. In an hour and a half.
[34:34] That's how long I have left. (mumbles)
[34:39] Jen lunch. Yes, I should lunch.
[34:43] But I will go lunch in an hour and a half when I'm done with this.
[34:48] 'Cause then I'll have to go get ready for the interview and stuff.
[34:52] So, and hi Ryan. Okay.
[34:57] Why else did I build a new site? No, I think this is...
[35:01] (upbeat music) Why Astro?
[35:04] (upbeat music) Why Astro?
[35:07] (upbeat music) So do you, Astro and Netlify,
[35:20] are they like the same thing? Because I know Netlify sponsors Astro.
[35:25] (upbeat music) Do y'all know?
[35:33] (upbeat music) Do y'all know?
[35:36] (upbeat music) Okay.
[35:43] (upbeat music) You sound like Jacob with the cloud flare.
[35:49] He always likes to remind me that cloud flare is there. Which makes sense.
[35:52] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[35:59] I need to look up because... (upbeat music)
[36:11] Somehow, and I'm not saying this was like accurate whatsoever, but I connected...
[36:16] (upbeat music) Uh...
[36:25] (upbeat music) Do you know how Jason,
[36:32] learn with Jason Jason built his site? (upbeat music)
[36:37] 'Cause somehow I connected... Oh, I think it was just because he was using Netlify to...
[36:51] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[36:57] But he used it to deploy it or he used it to build it. (upbeat music)
[37:02] 'Cause I think that's where I'm getting a little confused. Like everything you've said so far makes sense.
[37:09] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[37:18] (upbeat music) Oh.
[37:34] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[37:39] Hmm. (upbeat music)
[37:58] (upbeat music) Oh, okay.
[38:12] I need to like write this all out sometime. I will at another time, but why Astro?
[38:18] Everyone kept talking about Astro. And it sounded like a good place to start.
[38:23] Okay. First steps.
[38:28] (upbeat music) Ah, yay.
[38:35] Oh, I like that. (upbeat music)
[38:40] Yes, yes, I do have to bring you back for another episode. (upbeat music)
[38:47] Hmm. (upbeat music)
[38:53] First steps. (upbeat music)
[38:57] Oh. (upbeat music)
[38:59] Steps to build. (upbeat music)
[39:03] I'm okay with that. (upbeat music)
[39:17] I think Gift from Cloudflare, she's gonna be on the show too.
[39:24] Pretty excited. Okay.
[39:27] Steps to build. Find out what Astro is.
[39:32] Okay, I have templates. Find template.
[39:40] Loved. (upbeat music)
[39:45] She is so cool. Dude, she added me or followed me
[39:52] or she followed me on Twitter first. Wow.
[39:59] I got too excited. I didn't know what I was trying to say.
[40:01] (upbeat music) Ha, that's cool.
[40:09] That is cool. Anthony, you never replied.
[40:14] So y'all, Anthony just was like randomly like, "You almost beat me in Twitter followers."
[40:21] And I was like, "Nah, that's not gonna happen." And then it did happen and I screenshotted it to him.
[40:26] And then he never replied. I was really excited.
[40:29] But I feel like it's also just like a, you know, it's cool, but it's definitely not, it's,
[40:36] how to say it? It's not a...
[40:38] (laughs) Okay, this one is definitely worth sharing.
[40:51] And then he said, "I told you it would for sure happen so I didn't need to reply.
[40:56] All I would have said would have been, 'I told you so.'" That is fair.
[41:01] That is fair. Okay, so I want to do this.
[41:10] 'Cause I want to show the original site because my site looks so different.
[41:19] Like, let's put these side by side, y'all. This is something really cool.
[41:28] I don't know if Vicaria is still here, but it's really, really cool about ARC.
[41:33] Oh, maybe it won't. Please excuse my dog.
[41:39] I'm muting myself for a second. (upbeat music)
[41:44] (upbeat music continues) (upbeat music continues)
[41:51] (upbeat music continues) (upbeat music continues)
[42:07] (upbeat music continues) She may or may not be done crying.
[42:27] I'm not sure. But like, it's crazy to me how much different
[42:30] this site I made is compared to like looking at it now. It's just crazy to me.
[42:37] (upbeat music continues) (laughs)
[42:44] She is. She is one third of the family.
[42:46] Ryan, I love that you set up all these like shortcuts, but yes, I need to like show these.
[42:53] How do I show these? Screenshots side by side?
[42:58] I don't know. (upbeat music continues)
[43:04] Anyway, first one is. (upbeat music continues)
[43:11] (hums) (hums)
[43:16] (hums) (upbeat music continues)
[43:23] (hums) I don't know, I wanted to, what did you call this?
[43:36] (upbeat music continues) (upbeat music continues)
[44:00] (hums) (upbeat music continues)
[44:05] (hums) Oh.
[44:29] I do, I didn't even know there was a streamer mode. How do I put you in streamer mode?
[44:40] 'Cause it drives me bonkers and I either can turn it off permanently,
[44:44] like, and then I forget to turn it back on or... (upbeat music continues)
[44:52] Okay. (upbeat music continues)
[44:58] (upbeat music continues) Drives me batty.
[45:01] (upbeat music continues) I know.
[45:04] (upbeat music continues) Oh yeah, no, no, no, no.
[45:13] It was open in another window, I just didn't know. (upbeat music continues)
[45:18] Notifications. (upbeat music continues)
[45:24] (hums) Streamer mode.
[45:28] (upbeat music continues) Streamer mode.
[45:32] (upbeat music continues) Yay.
[45:37] (upbeat music continues) Thanks.
[45:40] (upbeat music continues) Oh, that is so exciting.
[45:43] (upbeat music continues) Yeah.
[45:50] (upbeat music continues) I love this.
[45:53] This is so happy. It's been driving me batty.
[45:55] Thank you. (upbeat music continues)
[45:58] (gasps) That is so exciting.
[46:01] (upbeat music continues) Yay.
[46:06] Thank you. Thank you.
[46:07] (upbeat music continues) It did.
[46:17] (upbeat music continues) Bigger.
[46:19] (upbeat music continues) Change.
[46:22] (upbeat music continues) And then.
[46:26] (upbeat music continues) (indistinct)
[46:33] (indistinct) (upbeat music continues)
[46:40] And, so. (upbeat music continues)
[46:45] Where did? (upbeat music continues)
[46:49] It's stuck. (upbeat music continues)
[46:53] (upbeat music continues) Where are all the many places I got stuck?
[47:02] (upbeat music continues) Let's see.
[47:07] (upbeat music continues) There are a lot of them.
[47:09] (upbeat music continues) Not knowing.
[47:13] (upbeat music continues) Components were, and how do you ask,
[47:25] how to duplicate them? (upbeat music continues)
[47:28] To put in different, (upbeat music continues)
[47:33] pages. (upbeat music continues)
[47:37] What else did I get really stuck on? (upbeat music continues)
[47:42] Uh. (upbeat music continues)
[47:46] Social images. (upbeat music continues)
[47:52] That was very infuriating. (upbeat music continues)
[47:56] A hero image. (upbeat music continues)
[48:01] Adding an image to intro component. (upbeat music continues)
[48:10] Understanding imports. (upbeat music continues)
[48:18] Blog everything. (upbeat music continues)
[48:23] What else did I get stuck on? (upbeat music continues)
[48:42] I know I got stuck on more. I'm having to lurk in old, old discord chats
[48:52] of what did I get stuck on? I commented it all.
[48:55] (upbeat music continues) Oh.
[49:02] (upbeat music continues) Fixed.
[49:06] (upbeat music continues) Side of thumbnail.
[49:10] (upbeat music continues) And then thumbnail.
[49:13] (upbeat music continues) Resizing.
[49:16] (upbeat music continues) Oh.
[49:31] (upbeat music continues) Yeah, I'm not necessarily gonna be using these on there.
[49:38] It's more of just like, I need to make sure I,
[49:44] (upbeat music continues) remember.
[49:47] (upbeat music continues) Yeah, no, 100%.
[49:52] I'm actually gonna, what I'm thinking I'm going to do is
[49:58] break these into like the, (upbeat music continues)
[50:04] but after you wrote it all down, make the slides way more sparse.
[50:14] Oh yeah, 100%. What I'm thinking is like
[50:19] using something I got stuck on and then putting like the code solution next to it.
[50:28] (upbeat music continues) So let me do one of these really quick.
[50:34] (upbeat music continues) So,
[50:43] (upbeat music continues) so adding this.
[50:50] (upbeat music continues) Well, let me actually leave it there.
[50:56] We'll just cross it out. (upbeat music continues)
[50:59] Can I cross out? Can I cross out?
[51:01] I wanna cross it out. Why isn't it a cross up?
[51:04] Can I make a cross out? (upbeat music continues)
[51:09] It's dumb. (upbeat music continues)
[51:12] Whatever. (upbeat music continues)
[51:15] No, I actually appreciate the input because I think that if you don't understand it,
[51:22] and plus I would be really bored just hanging out by myself.
[51:26] This is the entire reason I'm streaming this process 'cause I kept going, I don't know what I'm doing.
[51:33] And there is really a big part of...
[51:42] Thanks, Chase. A big part of the,
[51:48] like a body double. A body double is like, if those haven't heard of it,
[51:56] it's like you can work better just having someone else there.
[52:00] So it doesn't matter who it is or what it is or anything, but it's like, if you just have someone around,
[52:09] it's a lot easier to get done. And basically that's what I'm doing with streaming
[52:13] is I'm actually getting it done. Very excited.
[52:18] Why do these not look like they're lined up? (upbeat music continues)
[52:23] I like that you're in both YouTube and Twitch, Anthony.
[52:39] Oh, Ryan, I totally dig that. Yes, yes, that you do group study with.
[52:53] It's so helpful. And like, it helps so much is all I can say
[53:01] is that it really does. And like, I can't explain how much it really helps.
[53:08] Oh, let's try it. Let's try it to see if it works.
[53:14] Chase suggested. I don't know.
[53:19] It's... Okay.
[53:25] Alt function F9. I hope this doesn't break my computer.
[53:32] Wait. No, it did nothing.
[53:40] So good news is it didn't break my computer. At least that I know of.
[53:45] I've already broken it enough, but okay. Adding an image to components.
[53:58] Um. I am on the Mac.
[54:04] That is true. Jace, come over to Twitch.
[54:08] 'Cause I feel like I don't want to leave. I feel like I don't want to leave you
[54:12] out of the conversation. Wow, that made a lot of English.
[54:15] I don't want to leave you on out of the conversation. And then you know what's going on in case I don't.
[54:25] Um. Twitch huddle is this.
[54:33] Which my YouTube channel would be that too. But YouTube doesn't want me to use it.
[54:41] It thinks that it would be fun just using something I don't want.
[54:47] Very annoying. (upbeat music)
[54:52] Okay, so. I think I'm a little stuck here
[55:04] because I asked their team for help and I kind of want to ask Rose team.
[55:13] But I think it was just like a random someone that replied. But I kind of want to.
[55:19] Yay, Jace, welcome again. I kind of want to like show
[55:26] this is not how you answer a question. But it was just like somebody, a community member.
[55:32] It wasn't like someone from Astro proper. I think that'll be a time.
[55:41] Something bring up another time because reading the docs didn't help.
[55:48] (upbeat music) I will say, Anthony, like there's so many of you
[56:02] that I have to reach out to for this is y'all are really, really great
[56:07] at just helping me like figure out how to translate what I'm trying to say
[56:12] into actual searchable terms. 'Cause it's not something that I'm great at.
[56:19] (upbeat music) Let me show you what I actually ended up having to do.
[56:30] So there used to be, actually I can do this. So there used to be just this icon.
[56:45] And so I kept trying to switch it out from the icon. And I'm like, well, an icon isn't an image.
[56:52] So let me try that. And what was happening is I put the image down here,
[56:58] but I didn't tell it to be the eyebrow slot. And so like first I just tried going wherever icon was
[57:09] and replacing the image for it, but it didn't work. So it's actually this, and I didn't understand that.
[57:19] So it took some time. Although I'm just curious if y'all know this
[57:26] because this is just like a curiosity thing of mine. Okay, the image is little and I'm like, okay, cool.
[57:44] Whatever, I'll just like move it up one. And then this giant, ain't nobody need a picture of me.
[57:54] And it's like, why is there no in between? It's either small or it's tiny.
[58:03] But that is not something that I need to worry about today. Yeah, it's almost like, it's a little creepy.
[58:09] So I don't know. That is something that I will learn eventually.
[58:16] Oh. Oh, they said live code or do code samples.
[58:32] So I'm gonna stick to code samples because they, I'm trying to say,
[58:37] during my second interview, they were asking me questions about my code live
[58:49] and I just went bananas. Like I stumbled on my words.
[58:56] So I'm doing prepare code samples for them. I don't know.
[59:04] Um, well, what I was thinking is here. (upbeat music)
[59:12] I don't, I don't know why that's a big reason that I don't want to show them live, Jace.
[59:38] 'Cause I'm like, uh, I haven't figured that out yet. I don't know.
[59:42] And I haven't spent a ton of time like studying up on it yet because I'm like, dude,
[59:49] I just need to get my website working. What's in this?
[59:55] What's in this? Please.
[59:57] That's too small, probably too small. (upbeat music)
[60:21] Oh, the purpose of the slide deck is I have an interview and I have to show something that I am passionate about.
[60:36] That is a developer tool. So that's why I'm like,
[60:49] I don't want to do anything that I don't know what the answer is.
[60:53] Can I do some crouching? Croop again.
[61:18] Croop. (upbeat music)
[61:24] Yeah, like I don't want to like, yes, I have no problem being like,
[61:33] yo, so do any of you know how to do this? 'Cause I don't,
[61:36] but I actually want to show them what I was able to do so far.
[61:39] Pitch, I think. (upbeat music)
[61:50] It's almost there. (upbeat music)
[61:57] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[62:02] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[62:08] (upbeat music) Real quick, can you guys see that code okay?
[62:37] Or should I make it bigger? I'm applying for developer relations.
[62:53] And so presenting is like a key part of a lot of developer relation jobs at companies
[63:03] is like you have to present, you have to be able to talk to things,
[63:07] explain really well. So that's a big reason
[63:11] that they are asking for a presentation. I think this is a little,
[63:16] like I've had another company ask for like a blog or something like that.
[63:21] So it really differs company to company what they want to show.
[63:25] But it's basically almost always about content from what I've seen.
[63:29] And can y'all see this okay? Like, is the code big enough
[63:35] if I were to be showing this in a meeting, you think? Or does it need to be bigger?
[63:42] Oh, and as I say that, I'm like, oh, I have an idea of how to make it bigger
[63:50] and still look cool. (upbeat music)
[63:54] Oh yeah, that's a great call. That is a great call, thank you.
[64:11] (upbeat music) (mumbles)
[64:16] (mumbles) (upbeat music)
[64:25] (mumbles) (upbeat music)
[64:42] (mumbles) Okay, I like the highlight line.
[64:53] Maybe use something like, what is like carbon?
[65:00] I've never heard of that. I should look that up.
[65:02] Oh, you use it when you post snippets on social? (upbeat music)
[65:12] Oh, okay, let's look this thing up. (upbeat music)
[65:20] Ah, just kidding. It almost went, it almost went over there.
[65:32] Just a sec. Here we go.
[65:40] Let's see. Let me close this.
[65:45] I got too many screens going at once. (upbeat music)
[65:51] (laughs) Well, if it's gonna help the presentation,
[66:01] I wanna get distracted by shiny tools. (upbeat music)
[66:09] Ah, okay. I'll look at it later then.
[66:13] But I think that's a great call out. So, let's unclick this.
[66:20] (mumbles) No, back.
[66:35] (upbeat music) (mumbles)
[66:40] There we go. Everything moved.
[66:58] Thank you. Ah, okay.
[67:06] Thank you. (upbeat music)
[67:09] I will look, I'll manually highlight for now. 'Cause I've got an hour y'all.
[67:16] I've got an hour. But I'm feeling pretty good
[67:19] because there's now like a format and a flow. So.
[67:24] (upbeat music) Let's do these.
[67:30] Goes that way, bigger. (upbeat music)
[67:37] (mumbles) So this will remind me how I got stuck on it.
[67:51] And let me talk through it. And I feel like this should also be black.
[67:55] Be black. (upbeat music)
[67:59] The white line. No, back.
[68:01] White line. (upbeat music)
[68:05] That looks dumb. (upbeat music)
[68:09] It can be black on black. That's fine.
[68:14] (upbeat music) (laughs)
[68:21] This chat is so much better. I'm so glad you moved over.
[68:24] Okay. See, we got one done.
[68:28] We have one done. Okay.
[68:33] What other problems did I have? Social images.
[68:38] It's a really good one. I don't know what it was.
[68:43] (upbeat music) Let's make this one black.
[68:55] This way. (upbeat music)
[68:58] White. (upbeat music)
[69:01] Black. No.
[69:03] (upbeat music) Why am I having such a hard time?
[69:07] There we go. (upbeat music)
[69:10] And we will make this one white. (upbeat music)
[69:13] I think it's this one. I know.
[69:16] Damn it, no. (upbeat music)
[69:19] (laughs) There, okay.
[69:24] (upbeat music) (hums)
[69:28] (upbeat music) (hums)
[69:32] (upbeat music) (hums)
[69:37] (upbeat music) (hums)
[69:41] (upbeat music) (hums)
[69:46] (upbeat music) Do I have a lot of code snippets?
[69:51] No. I was just thinking I would do two code snippets.
[69:56] I just needed to like think of, um,
[69:59] where I got stuck. And I'm thinking that I'll just do the one I just did.
[70:06] And then, um, the,
[70:10] um, social images. Which I'm about to explain what social images are.
[70:19] 'Cause it was a weird thing I was trying to explain. So social images are,
[70:24] (hums) (hums)
[70:28] (upbeat music) What am I doing in my life?
[70:34] What? What?
[70:36] What is going on? (upbeat music)
[70:38] Okay. (upbeat music)
[70:41] This over here. And go back to this.
[70:46] Here we go. (upbeat music)
[70:51] (laughs) (laughs)
[70:57] That's a pretty good one. I like that one.
[70:59] They are chatty images. That's funny.
[71:03] They are preview and generate open graph meta tags.
[71:12] These things. These things.
[71:15] These things. But is this like how they're,
[71:20] what they're actually called is open graph meta tags? Like, is there an official name for these things?
[71:27] The image when things are shared. So,
[71:36] I'm going to go back to Canva. And
[71:42] okay. Open graph meta tags.
[71:47] Okay. I need this to not.
[71:51] No. God dammit.
[71:54] Not a flex. (upbeat music)
[71:58] This one. There we go.
[72:03] Oh, that works. (upbeat music)
[72:06] It's hard to read it. (upbeat music)
[72:15] (upbeat music) Now I forgot what the rest of it is called.
[72:30] Tags. Meta tags.
[72:32] (upbeat music) I would like to make you a little smaller so you fit.
[72:42] Okay. Here we go.
[72:45] Rude. (upbeat music)
[72:51] There. Okay.
[73:01] (humming) I do want to provide this.
[73:13] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[73:18] (upbeat music) It's a card.
[73:47] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[73:52] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[74:23] Name. (upbeat music)
[74:25] Link. (upbeat music)
[74:29] Oh, yeah. Oh, okay.
[74:44] Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get what you're saying.
[74:46] I think what I'm gonna have to do, especially 'cause I wanna show the site side-by-side,
[74:52] like, hey, this is what this template looked like beforehand. This is what it looks like now.
[74:58] There was one page because these just went down. Now there are multiple pages.
[75:05] I think it'll be good to, how am I gonna do this?
[75:19] I like your idea. I wanna show this.
[75:21] (upbeat music) I guess I'm just gonna switch back and forth.
[75:45] That's fine. I need to find what it used to be, though,
[75:49] which I think I have it. Lag.
[75:57] No, I updated it. Okay, well, that's cool.
[76:02] I didn't mean to. On about, this is what it used to be, and it didn't work.
[76:09] Stupid thing. (upbeat music)
[76:14] Two images, one of, oh, I just re-read your same message. Yeah, yeah, it's that kind of day, y'all.
[76:26] It's super fun. Super fun.
[76:41] Cancel. Wow.
[76:43] Let's do search image. Oh my God.
[77:10] It's on an eight-second loop. It's on like a five-minute loop.
[77:14] We're gonna have this one loop now. This one's my favorite.
[77:20] It's called "Feeding the Ducks." I actually found, oh my gosh, hello, Ramon.
[77:26] Glad you are safely in Amsterdam. Are, what time's your next flight leave?
[77:35] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[77:40] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[77:45] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[78:06] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[78:11] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[78:16] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[78:21] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[78:26] (upbeat music) Oh, yeah, don't do that.
[78:31] Don't do that at all. Don't you be mean with me.
[78:37] Oh. (upbeat music)
[78:45] Oops. (upbeat music)
[78:48] (humming) We want this one to be bigger.
[79:06] (upbeat music) Oh, wrong direction.
[79:13] Whatever. (upbeat music)
[79:16] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[79:21] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[79:27] Thank you, thank you. Have a safe flight.
[79:31] (upbeat music) Okay, so.
[79:34] (upbeat music) Want this one here, and then I want the real one over here.
[79:44] Not sure why I'm struggling. (upbeat music)
[79:48] Here we go. (upbeat music)
[79:51] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[79:57] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[80:02] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[80:07] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[80:12] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[80:18] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[80:23] (upbeat music) (humming)
[80:50] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[80:55] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[81:26] This is too much for one slide. (upbeat music)
[81:31] I wanted the final one slide. (upbeat music)
[81:36] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[81:41] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[81:47] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[81:52] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[81:57] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[82:02] (upbeat music) I'm just gonna do this later.
[82:08] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[82:13] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[82:18] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[82:23] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[82:29] (upbeat music) Make this big enough to read.
[82:32] Okay. (upbeat music)
[82:38] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[82:42] Oh, that's a good, that's a very good point. I was going to present on Canva.
[82:50] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[82:55] (upbeat music) Bye Ryan, have a wonderful day.
[82:59] (upbeat music) That's not, I don't even know how you animate on one of these.
[83:05] animate hey that's how you do it is you animate all right I'm digging this idea doggo calm down please
[83:37] do this is definitely something my my doggo is is an old lady and drives me bonkers she absolutely drives me
[84:18] bonkers but she's really cute and she's old ring to friends give me a little smolder here we go and there we go and there we go and
[84:51] then this one I'm going to be nerdy. I'm not weird.
[85:07] and then... animate. do the animation again.
[85:56] okay yes you are animated now to this one oh yeah yeah you know I I like doing things the complicated way. ring to friends. there we go.
[86:32] [MUSIC] I'm just not sure if it'll make all these together.
[87:03] [MUSIC] Both boxes.
[87:06] [MUSIC] I don't have the box.
[87:18] I guess I don't really need it. [MUSIC]
[87:23] Consistency. [MUSIC]
[87:53] All right, let's try to animate this one. [MUSIC]
[88:01] That was intense. [MUSIC]
[88:12] Animate page animations. [MUSIC]
[88:23] That does not help me. [MUSIC]
[88:36] You know what? Let's just do this.
[88:39] [MUSIC] Right?
[88:59] That's what I was thinking, but I have an idea. So I think that for this, actually let me delete this one.
[89:10] What I'll do is I'll just do three slides and do like a manual one. Send backwards.
[89:20] No, send it back. Send to the back.
[89:24] [MUSIC] So if I duplicate this three times or twice, I just need to -- no.
[89:36] Actually, I like your idea of the exact size thing. So put it in the center.
[89:46] And put this in the center. Okay.
[89:51] Send backwards. So --
[89:55] [MUSIC] Send to the back.
[90:03] [MUSIC] Group.
[90:33] All right. So --
[90:36] [MUSIC] Send to the back.
[90:41] [MUSIC] [MUSIC]
[91:20] Okay. So this one we want to animate.
[91:23] And I like this -- let's actually -- no, I don't want page out. All right.
[91:32] Move animations. Thank you.
[91:35] I said remove, bro. [MUSIC]
[92:04] Okay. [MUSIC]
[92:34] All right. Well, hopefully that works.
[92:37] [MUSIC] And then -- okay.
[92:47] So we have this going for us. It's doing something.
[92:52] [MUSIC] So what I'm thinking is --
[93:07] Send. Send.
[93:12] And I'll go like that. And I'll be like, yeah.
[93:16] Because at the beginning, that Twitter card thing said summary large. When in reality -- well, that's kind of fun.
[93:23] I can stay there for animation. It really all needed to be redone.
[93:28] Sure. [MUSIC]
[93:58] [MUSIC] It didn't all need to be redone, but you added the bottom, like, seven lines.
[94:14] Plus a comment. Oh, yeah.
[94:18] It actually got fully replaced. So it just was social media to begin with.
[94:23] And this now says Facebook as well. And Twitter added tags.
[94:28] That ended up working for all sites. When it wasn't working at all beforehand.
[94:33] So good call. I need to make sure that I say that.
[94:36] [MUSIC] So -- yeah.
[94:44] Cool. Okay.
[94:46] So we have -- adding the image. And this we will do -- oh.
[94:58] I could easily, like, clean this up and put it down here in the introduction part. Oh, I built a new site.
[95:06] You can name it why. Next steps.
[95:20] Sure. We'll leave it there.
[95:22] [MUSIC] And steps.
[96:06] [MUSIC] Okay.
[96:38] Templates. Built.
[96:48] Wow. Designed well.
[97:03] [MUSIC] [MUMBLING]
[97:35] And output. John has a new site.
[97:39] [MUSIC] [MUMBLING]
[98:09] Okay. [MUSIC]
[98:33] [MUSIC] [MUMBLING]
[99:17] [MUSIC] [MUSIC]
[99:37] [MUSIC] [MUSIC]
[100:17] [MUSIC] So I don't have to type this all out again.
[100:28] I'm putting into my Notion board. So I remember this.
[101:00] I need this one. [MUSIC]
[101:31] Oh, okay. Give me a second.
[101:33] I'll see if I can delete this page too. [MUSIC]
[101:58] Okay. This is not the right page.
[102:00] I want this over here. [MUSIC]
[102:15] Present. Present.
[102:24] Oh, is this all on the same page? Or did you do multiple pages?
[102:28] I guess I should look at it when I go back. Oh, this is cool.
[102:34] Oh, you have two pages. Okay.
[102:36] [MUSIC] Oh.
[102:46] Transition days. Did you animate this one?
[102:53] [MUSIC] This is animated.
[103:01] Oh. [MUSIC]
[103:09] That is cute. Yeah.
[103:14] But you also -- did you also do something -- Let me go back.
[103:20] Come back. Come back.
[103:23] Oh, yeah. I like zooms in and out.
[103:29] But I like how you do it on the bottom. That's a good call.
[103:33] I like that. [MUSIC]
[103:38] I like it. [MUSIC]
[103:50] Okay. I will do that in a moment.
[103:54] Okay. So the slides are setting up really well.
[103:58] We need to add a slide to remind me to show them the sites. Which is probably really silly.
[104:09] But I'm going to forget it unless it's in there. [MUSIC]
[104:21] Oh. Yeah.
[104:24] [MUSIC] Oh.
[104:29] [MUSIC] Oh.
[104:35] [MUSIC] Hold on.
[104:41] Hold on. [MUSIC]
[104:46] Even if I just do it to like these three, I don't know how it goes far. I don't know how it goes far.
[104:52] [MUSIC] Yours was actually like not an image.
[105:20] Yours was a real one. Oh, you use charts.
[105:25] Okay. Oh, it's that one.
[105:29] Oh, look at that. Oh, that's cool.
[105:32] [MUSIC] Oh.
[105:45] [MUSIC] Yeah.
[105:50] [MUSIC] We can make it very, very small.
[105:58] [MUSIC] Yeah, that's too small.
[106:09] [MUSIC] Oh, I went the other direction.
[106:13] That's not what I meant to do. [MUSIC]
[106:37] Hang that. [MUSIC]
[106:46] [INAUDIBLE] [MUSIC]
[106:59] And then move to this one. [MUSIC]
[107:08] Add a new one. [MUSIC]
[107:15] I don't know. Let's.
[107:17] [MUSIC] Mess around with it.
[107:21] [MUSIC] Going to add it to a few of them.
[107:33] [MUSIC] Okay.
[107:54] Present. Present.
[107:56] [MUSIC] Oh, weird.
[108:00] It kept them all the same length. Oh, because I have to put in the percentages for them.
[108:05] That's fine. [MUSIC]
[108:08] This is cool. Thank you.
[108:10] Thank you for going and finding that. That was really cool.
[108:13] [MUSIC] Go to the bottom.
[108:20] Please go to the bottom. Thank you.
[108:23] [MUSIC] I don't think I actually need this.
[108:37] [MUSIC] This one, I think under animate, it's page animations.
[108:53] [MUSIC] But that one was just kind of fun.
[108:59] That was a little intense. [MUSIC]
[109:06] Baseline is not bad. [MUSIC]
[109:20] I don't like party. [MUSIC]
[109:34] Oh. Like this?
[109:41] [MUSIC] Oh.
[109:57] [MUSIC] Oh.
[110:04] [MUSIC] Oh, this is way cool.
[110:11] [MUSIC] Can I select all of them so they all have the same transition?
[110:18] [MUSIC] Slide.
[110:24] It does. [MUSIC]
[110:39] Look at that transition, though. [MUSIC]
[110:46] This is fun. [MUSIC]
[110:50] I'm not going to lie. This is kind of fun.
[110:52] [MUSIC] Because, yeah.
[110:56] [MUSIC] That one kept it in a transition.
[111:06] I think it's a good one. You know?
[111:09] All right. I have like ten more minutes to spit out random stuff on here.
[111:15] I'm going to do the most important one. I'm going to do the most important one.

[114:27] Oops. That makes more sense.
[114:29] I went this way. And backwards.
[114:31] And backwards. And backwards.
[114:33] And backwards. And backwards.
[114:35] And backwards. And backwards.
[114:37] And backwards. And backwards.
[114:39] And backwards. And backwards.

[114:47] Oh, yeah. That is a good call, Jace.
[114:49] That is a good call, Jace. You go in here.
[115:15] I need this to go like this. And this.
[115:20] And this. And this.
[116:10] And this. And this.
[116:22] And this. And this.
[116:34] And this. And this.
[116:42] And this. And this.

[117:46] And this. And this.
[117:54] And this. And this.
[118:07] Okay. So we'll go through that.
[118:12] We'll go through this one. We'll go through this one.
[118:17] Okay. I can talk about this.
[118:51] Thank you. I think I'm going to actually end up sharing my VS code and stuff.
[118:56] Even though I kind of really don't want to. Just because some of it is going to be like.
[119:02] It's going to be easier to explain it than doing screenshots. So hopefully it goes well.
[119:13] So hopefully it goes well. Like this, like.
[119:18] Building a page is going to make more sense. I'm going to keep forgetting their group already.
[119:28] I'll just delete this page and see if I can talk a really long time. One or the other.
[119:37] Thank you. I really need a job.
[119:41] Oh yeah. I really need a job.
[119:51] I don't like this. We're going to get rid of it.
[119:59] Next. And.
[120:06] Oh, that's fine. It's kind of like their icon.
[120:08] It's convenient. Sure.
[120:26] No, actually it is for a web free company. That they were like, Hey, do some type of developer.
[120:36] Yeah. And I just built my entire.
[120:45] Website that I was like, I like Astro. Let's do something about Astro. So.
[120:53] And I think it's cool because it's like a beginner's viewpoint on it. Especially there's so many things that I needed to get help on.
[120:59] So. Actually didn't stream much of my.
[121:24] You know, Was like, oh, I'm just doing this. So I have a portfolio.
[121:34] But now that I'm like, how to get. It took me like three weeks.
[121:38] I'm pretty sure I've been working on this thing for three weeks. I feel like the introduction is the same as the agenda.
[121:52] I feel like the introduction is the same as the agenda. I feel like the introduction is the same as the agenda.
[121:55] I feel like the introduction is the same as the agenda. I will reply to you eventually. I promise.
[121:59] I've been working on this stupid presentation. It's not stupid. I'm just frustrated at it.
[122:02] I'm not going to have. What do y'all think? Do we need an agenda page?
[122:11] Do you need an agenda page? Because I feel like the introduction. Goes through the agenda page.
[122:15] But maybe it doesn't. I don't know.
[122:22] I don't know about the introduction. On it.
[122:35] Cut the intro page and speak to the bullets. In the intro on the agenda.
[122:40] Yeah. Yeah.
[122:50] I'm kind of thinking. Yeah, I think I'm just going to remove the agenda one.
[122:58] And maybe I'll just call. This one.
[123:00] It's an introduction. Why Astro.
[123:04] And then. I think this is a great way of explaining it.
[123:18] I need to update over here. One for the goal of this presentation and how we're going to do it.
[123:29] I feel like this is a very good agenda. I don't know.
[123:36] Agenda. Steps.
[123:44] And how I got stuck. You can be.
[124:02] So why. Then it'll be the same size.
[124:21] You can go here. It'll be a progress bar. Once I update it.
[124:53] Yes. FYI.
[124:59] Which is actually kind of funny. Cause Jan's was hanging out with us over on YouTube.
[125:06] But then everybody else was on Twitch. And now it's the opposite.
[125:08] Now. YouTube's a cool place.
[125:14] The progress bar will be updated though. So.
[125:45] Yeah. I like Twitch.
[125:52] I mean, I like YouTube too, but I like Twitch. No, there's not an even number.
[126:03] So. Challenge.
[126:21] I don't know if the word will fit. Let's find out.
[126:28] Challenges. Oh, this is exciting.
[126:40] Some other color, my color palette. Gray.
[126:50] That means I can actually also. Get rid of this one.
[126:59] I like getting rid of slides. Don't like this color.
[127:05] Oh. You can be the one splash of orange in the entire thing.
[127:14] Yeah. And yeah,
[127:28] I will say that I probably should have said this before you switched over. It's going to be.
[127:32] I'm technically four minutes over because I need to actually go. I don't do things on a timely basis.
[127:37] I have talked about before. I'm about to end.
[127:42] But I need to finish this. So. Okay.
[127:56] Yeah. Cause my interview is in 55 minutes and. I probably shouldn't go to an interview.
[128:01] Like that. I mean, I could.
[128:06] I could do it. I could do it. I could do it. I just need to look a little more put together.
[128:11] Walk the dog first. And eat.
[128:15] That's what we were looking for on this other page. Components.
[128:25] Components is a big thing that I was stuck on. Components.
[128:32] Yeah. Intro component image.
[129:00] So. Next.
[129:22] Or. Okay.
[129:30] Maybe we can make these. Okay.
[130:03] You should be like. Okay.
[130:41] How many is this? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And then this.
[130:50] This. Okay.
[131:46] Okay. You don't need to be necessarily.
[132:02] Okay. We had to.
[132:30] Okay. And.
[132:43] Okay. Okay.
[133:14] Okay. Okay.
[133:52] Okay. Okay.
[134:43] Okay. Okay.
[135:18] Okay. Okay.
[136:09] Okay. Okay.
[136:44] Me. All right.
[136:50] Y'all I'm done enough. I will delete these pages if I don't get them done in time.
[137:02] Okay. That's a good thing or a bad thing, but this was super, super fun.
[137:12] And thank you to everybody that has joined was joining. Thank you. Thank you.
[137:16] It's. It's definitely been a.
[137:20] A journey and a time. And it took me like two and a half hours just now.
[137:24] But lots of thoughts. Lots of.
[137:28] Yes. Enjoy going to go. Yes.
[137:32] Yes. Bye.
[137:35] You're still around. Bye.
[137:37] Thank you everyone. Let's see if there's anyone to read to.
[137:43] Oh, there is. Let's go.
[137:49] Here. Okay.
[137:52] Bye. Oh.
[137:55] Okay. Well, I'll write someone else.
[137:58] There we go. I don't know if y'all have ever checked out bash funny stuff, but it's pretty good.
[138:06] I like her style. Okay, bye!
[138:13] Bye. (upbeat music)
