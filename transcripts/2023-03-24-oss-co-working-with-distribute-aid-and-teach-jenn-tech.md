[00:00] Welcome to another episode of teach gen tech and today is co-working with Distributed. At the moment it's just Jen working but Taylor will be here soon so
[00:14] it will be co-working because it will be more than one of us. Yet at the moment I am going through I don't know if anybody else has experienced this but hey you
[00:27] got a new phone yay it's gonna be really exciting and then you think you transferred everything you erase your other phone and then you realize that
[00:41] you're two-factor on your old phone you erased it. Let's just say I'm not exactly excited about this. So I'm working on restoring my old phone just in case it
[01:03] magically decides to work and I'm working on my new phone so until Taylor gets here I'm kind of just staring at my phones yeah I'm being rude I'm that
[01:14] person like right now but we will be working on I believe Taylor I'm looking at our previous messages wanted to do some live coding in a bit and then I am
[01:30] working on my Miro board getting all the champion program like transferred over because it was not as copy/paste as I was hoping it was much more oh my gosh
[01:46] there's somebody okay okay yeah there are a lot more things to move from Lucidchart to Miro because it doesn't let me just like copy and paste the
[01:59] words no no no it want it like if I try to copy and paste it it does it as photos and I'm like yo that's that's not helping so yeah I am hopefully not
[02:17] gonna be staring at my phone much longer and it's it's doing some things and stuff so we'll just let everything go set aside anyway let's see what we are
[02:30] doing and hello to everyone joining thank you for joining and FYI I went to a concert last night which is really exciting it was so much fun yet y'all I
[02:52] am I'm struggling today like I canceled my first meeting of the day which I normally start work at 6 a.m. today I started work at 945 and I was originally
[03:11] supposed to have a 8 a.m. and I asked to cancel and what up Laura Oh Laura I got my iPad I'm gonna see if I can stream stuff from that tomorrow to show notes
[03:28] no idea if that's gonna work and at the moment I am fighting with Miro which is weird because I feel like they just did an update because I just used it on
[03:46] another area another program and it was having issues I don't know why oh it would help if I like share my screen share screen oh and also Laura I may or
[04:08] may not be sending you a link to join via paying an OBS which would be exciting I work I did OBS last two days it was a little tricky so you know I'm
[04:28] like a let's see what's going on I may or may not I'm not sure but why is this thing like being weird look it's like stuck on this no I don't know why okay
[04:48] how about how about you would be Miro what are you doing and it's like stuck on this hand oh there we go okay so we don't have a
[05:05] hand anymore yay now can we do text no is Miro having issues let's look at outages
[05:32] March 23 it says it's fine why like all of a sudden I can't do anything I am logged in as me
[05:46] really I love Miro but it is just okay let's try from my computer mask oh maybe okay that worked oh wait I think it's working now yay hopefully oh yeah thank
[06:07] you Laura Laura just shared on how to mirror your iPad screen to your Mac yes yeah I I know that I can mirror it that way so I might just do a screen share
[06:23] that way but I want to see if I can I don't know I might be making it more difficult in my head no joke it's it's a thing I do it from time to time but now
[06:37] that we have Miro working it looks like let's set up the board and I am working on the dev champion program and for those joining basically just hanging out
[06:58] right now Taylor should be joining here soon and I am working on bringing excuse me bringing this Lucidchart information
[07:17] into the Miro board because Lucidchart is cool and all but like look I don't have like the pages anywhere oh they are showing this time they didn't show the
[07:31] other time when I was working on it they weren't showing at all but I am definitely one of those people that are like out of sight out of mind so I
[07:41] figured to fix that you know make it all in a Miro board so they're not out of sight yes okay and we have to manually move stuff very annoying so if we do a
[08:01] new text box we do that hey we at least have some traction oh it's not what I meant to click what are all of you up to today Laura what are you doing today
[08:17] and did you figure out your CFP that you wanted to do Laura I've been meaning to ask you that and for those just as a heads-up Laura is a guest on the show
[08:36] every other Friday doing teach gen Python and then also we co-host a show on Mondays currently called misc Mondays or miscellaneous Mondays we've also
[08:51] thought about possibly renaming it possibly doing a segment called mark down and makeup we need to let Aaron know about this though because Aaron
[09:02] would need to be a part of it as well who knows so and on Monday we stream talking about CFPs oh I'm only sharing the one window and I thought I was
[09:14] sharing well okay let's make sure I share my entire screen and so on Monday we were talking about CFPs which are call for proposals and that is for
[09:31] people to fill out information to submit for a talk for a conference and we were discussing topics for that and I was talking about being a potato which is
[09:44] what I wish I was doing today because it is for me being a potato is just like basically hanging out away from everybody last night went to a concert
[09:58] and I'm just like dude dude I really just want to go to sleep yeah Laura's working on fun things templates for SE2 orbital extension engine that is
[10:18] cool yay right I'm taking a phone break since I am trying to see if I can hmm make you factor back hopefully I don't remember all the two factors that were
[10:33] in there it is gonna be really difficult you do I'm gonna see maybe it's gonna be nice like let's copy this
[10:47] incoming thing and what does it do over here if I paste it that is kind of cool but it pasted as a photo yo random spam bot spammy thing spam I guess this is
[11:07] good as ever to figure out how to block someone all right let's figure out how to block you and we put you in spam luck wait you have to report first let's
[11:21] report before let's report you are spam and spammy spam spam oh it's probably a bot all right
[11:37] yeah okay Oh 16 p.m. Mountain Standard Time is a timestamp and also block you yay and maybe I delete the message y'all you would think that like being a
[12:11] streamer for oh goodness like a long time since July of last year that I would like know how to do this better I a lot of times just ignore them but
[12:29] they are blocked so we are doing better there and for those joining from distribute aid Taylor will be here soon at some point I don't know what when
[12:41] Taylor will be here I will say worst case I'm at least working on some distributed stuff well I panic about my two-factor authentication and I am
[12:54] currently working on moving everything from Lucidchart over to Miro because it works better in my brain and yes so if we're streaming from both channels right
[13:15] now oh thanks Laura that's helpful so my ads on my channel so those joining on Jen's nod that channel for teach Jen tech I had ads on and they were getting
[13:35] really annoying like they played like for a minute and a half for someone and I was like okay that's a lot a lot so I turned my ads off and Laura would join
[13:47] and kept seeing ads and we were like WTF and this is why because if you're an affiliate you can't well all right please be patient with ads that's what
[14:01] we're gonna go with oh I really wish these copy and paste it better but they don't so we're just gonna do them side-by-side and a lot of this is like
[14:24] not up to date but I'm still copying and pasting it over because I don't want to forget something when I'm like oh I'm just gonna stop using that one okay
[14:42] yeah we're not gonna launch the first cohort next month just for everybody's knowledge we started like decided that we were gonna do this and started on it
[15:04] back in December okay and then between all of us with travel and just working on things it just doesn't always pan out for us to stream and work on things and
[15:26] I will say I have found that I am NOT the greatest at doing some of this without body doubling which is like having other people around so yeah I
[15:41] need to work on that a and B I wasn't working on it for a while and now I am so we will get updated dates probably next week.
[15:56] do-do-do-do-do-do-do and from time to time I will be distracted by staring at my phone seeing if I can get that updated
[16:34] hello I feel like this is gonna be easiest now
[17:06] so I'm just gonna copy and paste them all get them over and then we'll format I will say formatting is something that I enjoy yet can get really really stuck
[17:16] on which can be annoying for people oh no these are all gonna be separate ones that is annoying okay let's just do
[17:36] tracks what do y'all use do you have like a brainstorming tool like this or use
[17:53] anything like would you rather write it out on paper how do y'all brainstorm visualization really glad it does spell check data testing okay cool so for this
[18:30] next one I know that we had names on here that we didn't necessarily want public you know because we don't know if they'll actually help us and that would
[18:43] be really awkward if we're like yo dude like you should help us and then we never actually verified with them so I will copy over what is public
[19:02] hello everybody I'm currently copy and pasting things over exciting time over here oh no I lost my other window and I also hard reset or like got a new phone
[19:23] and then I hard reset the old phone before realizing that my two-factor transfer so I'm currently restoring my old phone and kind of going through
[19:35] panic mode but I'm trying to like be very calm while I copy and paste all this stuff over it seems like it's an activity like a Zen copy and paste like
[19:44] might have accidentally erased my whole life you know kind of yeah because I'm like a I - I would say for like you and like distributed it would be kind of
[19:56] funny because I keep doing this stuff and I finally got it all set up and now I can't get you know get into it but like everything else like I don't even
[20:10] know what else was out there that I had on there like github what are you transferring your phone number so like you can still get the two-factor
[20:22] authentication text messages on your new phone but I only had it through Google authenticator oh is that not account based because I use one password and
[20:34] like one password will sync the two-factor stuff across devices so if I ever lost access to my phone I still got one password on I think so I think so
[20:45] but I'm not sure oh thank god they're still here there we go Taylor shows up and things happen in the world ladies and gentlemen I had a
[20:59] restore my old phone because it didn't show on the new phone and because oddly it worked from like I had a hard reset my own phone once like a while ago and
[21:18] everything restored so I was like that's why I tried it but on the new phone so that's what I'm doing it's I mean it's exciting but it's not horribly exciting
[21:28] over here yeah so what are you up to what do you want to work on today I did a lot of like partnerships work last week which was cool it's funny
[21:45] actually because there's a like tech partner of ours called needs list and so they've built this like a matching software that they're a few years older
[21:56] than us they're still coming out of the same like grassroots like Greek sort of scene that we were involved with early on but they're like you know a couple
[22:04] years ahead and so they get big grants like they got a big grant from Google to deploy their software to Ukraine right and so we're okay you know kind of all
[22:15] of our Ukraine partners are kind of loosely working together you know obviously a lot of folks so like that's cool but they basically like like hey
[22:29] can we just like bundle your supply chain support into the grants and stuff that we write going forwards because they realize that like most of their
[22:37] their customers right as a tech firm like yes want to pay for the tech because that sources aid to go help out in the event of a disaster or whatever
[22:47] is going on right but they once the match is made they need to be able to get it there you know I think it's actually a really great approach like
[22:55] how da can collaborate with a bunch of different actors right like their tech so they're high margin so they can you know afford to pay people like
[23:05] professional grant writers and stuff like that right we're logistics it's traditionally a low margin industry we're grassroots we're running as close
[23:13] to zero as we can you know and and so we don't have that same type of like can I is business privilege a word you know like I don't know but we implement each
[23:27] other really well right okay cool y'all go get deals and just include us in in your deal you know so that was like kind of a fun partnerships development thing
[23:41] yeah I was just gonna say I don't know if Miro and I are fighting or it's my computer it's like look it just disappeared I'm not sure the browser
[23:56] maybe like yeah that's usually my first medieval website starts acting up I go incognito or I try like a different browser you know yeah look at this I
[24:07] wonder if it's gonna tribute aid or great yeah okay so it's loading now but look it just disappeared but this I think it's my browser because like this
[24:25] stuff up here will just start glitching out like random yeah what plugins do you have installed I guess it was like a plug-in thing maybe um it started doing
[24:37] it after the last update I did so that's why I'm thinking it's Chrome I was it just Chrome's got a bug yeah so I guess I could uh you know start working on
[24:48] that because you're here so I have someone to talk to you I don't have to I always feel weird when I'm streaming by myself because I'm like I'm just gonna
[24:58] talk yeah I'm not even worried about the grocery store would say yeah I'm not even worried about that it's more just like it's awkward it's more like like
[25:11] because I I am gonna at least like once a week I'm gonna start streaming by myself learning how to like set up all these database types and more data
[25:20] infrastructure stuff but I'm like what do I do when I'm just talking to myself yeah this is cool yeah yeah okay I guess I can't really quit Chrome because then
[25:36] it will boot us from our stream I feel like I'm logged in though or is that not oh yeah you are that's true I don't know I mess anything up like no no I think
[25:50] you're good I think you're good yeah and let me see let me look into getting Firefox really quick and then I will switch over okay yeah give me give me
[26:04] like a one-minute warning before you jump off here I'm just trying to get a tweet out real quick with the twitch link that's smart I'm not always I
[26:14] haven't been great about posting when I'm live okay Firefox yay oh shit I'm gonna have to like remember how to log into things now okay
[26:55] gonna troubleshoot from all the above because at least I have to factor right now
[27:02] what my computer is doing the weirdest shit yeah mine's being really slow too but I don't know if that's my computer at this point or just Twitter acting up
[27:23] because Twitter has been getting worse and worse and worse I literally can't even draft a quote tweet right now oh damn I hate when that happens or there
[27:53] was like one point where you couldn't even like reply to people it put it to drafts or like there's been so many issues yeah where am I going this is
[28:05] dream yard I really should get on mastodon but like I don't want to put that effort in oh shoot you know what happened today we won the best
[28:26] nonprofit in Scandinavia it's uh yeah it was definitely one of those like some group made up their own awards and then like we could pay them 350 for a trophy
[28:43] or like five grand to be featured in their magazine or something and why no thank you but I will I will take the like best you know nonprofit in
[28:53] Scandinavia slap that on a resume like congratulations Jen thanks for volunteering with the the best nonprofit in Scandinavia 2023 yay oh my gosh I met
[29:11] with Weston today really cool dude right yes so just for everyone watching Weston is our head of projects and administration so he's worked on a whole
[29:31] bunch of stuff from a lot of the content that we're working on getting up with our generic pages kind of helping create issues to kind of rounding up our
[29:43] different projects and also making it easier to get you know kind of different types of contributors on board I've kind of laid the groundwork for something
[29:53] like Jen's dev champions program and most recently it's been working with me on our 2023 strategy and kind of shifting that over to more of a
[30:04] formally defined vision you know it's like kind of goals and objectives and things so yeah no what do you think what do y'all talk about uh that he was
[30:20] recently in Arizona and I'm from Arizona and that so we're gonna meet next week because I told him I was like I need help like building some structure to this
[30:35] but somebody that understands Taylor like going in like building structure for something but like trying to be like okay Taylor is very big picture how do I
[30:49] break this down doesn't always translate to everybody because like him understanding your vision - I'm very excited about this because I think even
[30:58] like a one-hour session with him which we'll do offline will be really really helpful and give us more of a time frame guideline because I know that it's gonna
[31:10] take a lot of work but it's been just figuring that kind of stuff out so I'm really excited because I'm like nobody else is really gonna understand how to
[31:23] break down Taylor isms that's kind of what I called it is the Taylorism that's good yeah yeah listen it's pretty good they're definitely something like like I
[31:33] feel like Weston Nicole and Sarah now for sure but like today you know that like we're they get to deal with like a full Taylor you know yeah yeah and um he
[31:45] also mentioned that it could be good for me to join one of the coffee team meeting things on Friday yeah please come hang out at team time sometime you
[31:58] and Ramon and everyone else is kind of regularly involved is invited it's there's something I think about most of the like full-time folks do every week
[32:09] but we're wary of like adding a bunch of meetings to everyone's calendar but anytime you want to join I think it's a 1030s on Fridays yeah I probably go look
[32:22] at that but I haven't yet because we met and then I was like I'm gonna set up my new devices then got distracted so you know what I have to do I have to I have
[32:37] to install a new operating system at some point I've been delaying it for about a year on elementary OS right but I made my like the the Linux like kind
[32:50] of cool file you know that like partition too small actually I only made it 25 gigabytes and which was dumb so I need to like reformat my drive and then
[33:00] I want to move over to Ubuntu because elementary OS is lagging behind it's still unlike Ubuntu it's based off of Ubuntu 18 and like now I think there's
[33:08] like 20 and the latest and greatest even gonna be 21 or something like that and that's a problem usually I wouldn't care right like whatever I'm a generation
[33:18] behind on you know Linux that's fine except I can't upgrade node which means I can't upgrade Gatsby on our landing site project because Ubuntu 18 doesn't
[33:31] support node 14 so I'm like oh fuck like my dependency tree is like forcing this thing that I've put off for a whole year which is gonna like it's all cascading
[33:43] of work I've procrastinated on right it's not just the OS it's the hard drive reformat it's not just that yeah I want you as you're mentioning this I
[33:56] want to boot camp my Mac to go to Windows as well and I don't know if I would have enough I would think I would have enough space to also do Linux if
[34:12] I'm doing one I might as well do the other at the same time it's what I'm thinking true but like Mac is already like kind of Linux II you know yeah
[34:22] that's fine like Windows or like Linux and Windows makes the most sense unless you like really need a specific Linux operating system for some like work
[34:34] projects but even then like we all have like virtual machines now you know yeah and that's something that I was actually talking about for my work projects of am
[34:45] I going to need to do like tutorials on Linux and I was like I think doing it on Mac and Windows is good because there's a very very small amount if we see that
[34:58] change yes but for now no yeah maybe maybe one day maybe one day maybe one day but the only reason I'm like installing Windows is so I can play a
[35:18] game which is very silly oh dude I missed that I can't access half my steam library because that's the game on Linux yeah yeah I am currently obsessed
[35:32] with a Genshin impact I guess I've heard of that a lot it's like reddit so I scroll past yeah so I can play it on my phone which is cool but it's like I feel
[35:51] like I need to detach it from my phone because I'm a little too attached to it and that's fair that's kind of like having like an Xbox or something back in
[36:03] the day was like yeah here's the gaming thing you use it when you're gaming you know not on my laptop it's like easy to like do a few hours or like oh I could
[36:13] be like a quick round of Counter-Strike or something you know mm-hmm all right there like no I'm in the office right now Tyler my partner he just got a new
[36:25] laptop and the first thing he did was download Counter-Strike yeah let's go to so exciting I will not be able to play that on my laptop so sad all right uh so
[36:37] I was all my D&D friends they all play apex and I'm like so my first thing was like I was like dude you should download apex and play with my D&D friends and he
[36:49] was like no that's weird no oh this is this is interesting so I'm happy to keep sharing on my stuff I don't know if you want to do your stuff I don't know what
[37:04] screen this is let me let me get a good pod booted up here by the way Twitter is definitely like not working for me let's see it pod works or if I have to like
[37:16] a restart or something I don't know I kind of feel like a lot of a things are not working just in general just things are broken today which is fine yeah it
[37:33] kind of makes sense though that whole banking crisis for all the startups haven't like I don't know there's the internet just gonna like slowly shut down
[37:43] right one can dream right like exactly feel like every developers got there like oh if the internet like no longer
[38:00] exists what do I do you know I was like I know too many devs that have like left you know coding and like started a bakery or got into woodworking or
[38:10] something like that you know okay yay we have a gazillion interception II stuff yeah thank you I
[38:45] feel like this is something that I love about co-working is you can just be working on the stuff you need to work on like you don't have to 100% focus on
[39:01] everything else and with body doubling like and being able to do this I get more done yeah yeah no that's for sure like I like this stream co-working
[39:16] format though because it's like I feel like I'm more likely to make it because there's an audience like I do like that like minor performance aspect of it
[39:25] right yeah it's like oh like I'm hanging out co-working with Jen but also like you know like doing that to engage folks like whoever wants to tap into what's
[39:33] going on with da this week right so fun yeah yeah definitely what are you working on this week I'm working on generic pages we're trying to get images
[39:50] in there so just kind of like it's already set up on the content management system so I just got to like get that pulled into Gatsby the right way that
[40:01] reminds me um what content management system are you using we're using forestry but it's about to reach its end of life and we need to upgrade to Tina
[40:14] she can check out at tina.io you can actually have you used Contentful yeah we started with Contentful I liked it from like content management side but it
[40:29] definitely had a very enterprisey feel and and we ended up with forestry because it was one of the few git based CMS's where it actually like checks in our
[40:43] content into git so it's right there in the repository whereas like Contentful and other things it's like an external you know they host your your content
[40:53] database on their servers right and then you gotta download that which is meant for it made a much slower dev experience but yeah what were what are you gonna
[41:06] say about Contentful um so when Jason from learn with Jason lingdorf was on the show he was talking about on his show because he streams and
[41:21] does you know has a bunch of guests too that he uses something like Contentful that makes a workflow where it auto generates his images for him oh yeah I
[41:35] was like I need to do that because um between my two shows I'm never gonna get caught up if all of this stuff is still manual so I think my hardest thing is I
[41:48] don't know what can actually be a process and what can't so I'm like mmm slowly working through all of that yeah totally so that's really interesting I
[42:00] feel like that's not Contentful specific like that's the content management and they might have some like you know kind of unique functionality built in around
[42:09] that but to me that sounds like you know just using static site rendering technology which is like what we're using with the landing site with Gatsby
[42:19] for example and and just having you know a workflow you know how it like generates your HTML it like generates your your kind of like react pages for your site
[42:31] it could also generate images you know and you just like oh like new week you know like let me update the date and kind of confirm the events and you know
[42:41] commit that and then it would build the images that you use you know for your tweets and stuff like that hmm
[42:52] but it's really interesting you mentioned that because I feel like I want to get to a point probably at some point this year where we can generate
[43:04] social media posts using using our landing site because we'll be pulling in shipping data from our data pipeline and then we can use that you know maybe we
[43:15] also have to like add some stuff to the content management you know system like upload the photos our partner send us or something we can use that to like
[43:23] generate the post and save our admin team a bunch of time oh can everyone see me I'm just gonna bump the font size up a little bit there yeah I can see it
[43:42] better now thank you totally as always if you all can't see just say something so you mind if I like talk through as I'm going keep chit-chatting you know
[43:55] but just if folks want to follow along with the live coding like it's kind of natural for me I guess okay so we're working on importing this image with
[44:12] caption kind of data object in through generic pages so we got our content blocks here we're getting this issue around dates so I've added
[44:28] yeah where do we text here we go image let's saying date on object does not match expected type okay
[44:57] so up here we define the schema we're saying that date uploaded it's gonna be a date date there's gonna be a date they're saying property date so they
[45:31] could be no I see it's basically optional to include date wonder if we solve this with like an or undefined get the property does not match expected
[46:05] type so what's happening here we got these utils passing and also we're saying like hey go get me this date property right and that's just saying
[46:34] make sure I push the latest that looks like I have you
[46:58] get property it's an instance of date you
[47:12] you you
[47:16] you you
[47:20] you you
[47:24] you you
[47:29] you you
[47:33] you you
[47:37] you you
[47:41] you you
[47:45] you you
[47:49] you you
[47:53] you you
[47:57] you you
[48:01] you you
[48:06] you you
[48:10] you you
[48:14] you I actually just say
[48:21] you you
[48:25] you you
[48:29] you you
[48:33] you you
[48:38] you you
[48:42] you you
[48:46] you you
[48:50] you you
[48:54] you let's try that out if other errors
[49:23] yeah date uploaded does not match expected type I think it's an issue where date uploaded is a string so what we actually want is to get
[49:43] property right so
[50:00] so so
[50:23] so basically say get the string property make the date
[51:02] now what happens if the date is like you like a date dot basically like hey here's the date for now here's the date for some malformed date string or
[51:24] something it's me not a number right invalidate like an is man okay that's an is man check so
[52:00] um yes
[52:17] okay so
[52:49] so so
[53:25] so so
[53:49] right so I'm going to throw an error here basically if we have like an all date or something
[54:19] so so
[54:31] so so
[55:07] right and we should probably test that property
[55:36] all right so I'll add one more case here so
[56:14] so so
[56:42] so so
[57:06] so so
[57:34] so so
[58:18] let's go run our test real quick that's running how you doing Jen
[58:34] uh almost done and I'm like falling asleep while I'm writing this just because I'm so tired from the concert last night but it is like so much easier to read what we were looking at nice
[59:02] which I am happy to show you here shortly I am grateful that somebody decided to get Miro because I was like hardcore struggling on charts. Yeah, you're really excited about listen charts, but it seems like mirrors better without like kind of whiteboard style or something. Yeah, I think so. I think that's a big part of it.
[59:34] Yeah. So it's not color coordinated, but when you're done, I am happy to show you the updates of the workflow that was not there for anyone to actually be able to understand what was going on between all of the pages until now.
[59:53] Okay, that sounds good. You want to give me another 10 minutes here maybe and then we can wrap up you can show me what you've been working on. Yes, yes I do because then I can make this actually like more eligible. Thank you.
[60:06] Thanks. Whoo.
[60:50] Sweet. Maybe it'll work.
[60:58] Yeah. Okay.
[61:31] It does not match expected type. Okay, but It's coming from yet property TS 17.
[61:57] Forget the upside like hey, Get the string property.
[62:30] They're actually giving it to me as a date. That would be cool.
[62:57] Okay. Okay.
[63:34] I mean, I can't see myself because I'm just on my laptop. So, oh, no, it's not that it's just like I'm so tired right now.
[63:47] I'm going to go to sleep. Okay.
[64:01] Okay. Okay.
[64:30] Undefined. That makes no sense. Take a couple of them.
[65:01] Okay. Oh, no.
[65:52] I can just kind of skip TypeScript sometimes during the dev process. Yeah, like it's going to figure out the type of this thing, and I could remember the TypeScript way to do it, but I don't have to because it's just a console log, you know,
[66:07] Yeah. I've been explaining TypeScript to people as like the barista of your mocha.
[66:18] Like they're the people that like put all of the ingredients together, but when it executes, you just get handed a mocha. But all the ingredients still go into it.
[66:31] Yeah, yeah, that's a good way of putting it. Okay.
[67:27] Oh, my God. Oh.
[67:44] Okay. Okay.
[68:39] Okay. Aha. Okay, it is an actual date. That is nice to know.
[69:05] I'm going to run our original property. I'm going to copy this.
[69:13] We basically don't have to change this guy any. So,
[69:34] equals. Oh.
[70:06] No, our changes here. Property.
[70:22] Date. Date.
[70:38] Okay. Okay.
[71:15] Okay. Okay.
[71:54] Oh. Okay.
[72:34] Okay. Okay.
[73:00] Okay. Well, we are definitely getting through this stuff.
[73:45] Well, I might be leaving you. That's okay. Let me.
[73:51] I am literally struggling, but. That's all good. Let me commit where I'm at.
[73:56] Okay. It is way easier to read, at least in my opinion on this thing.
[74:03] I'm excited. Okay.
[74:59] Okay. Almost there. It's just running the.
[75:05] You're good. Okay.
[75:15] Okay. I will go to my screen. Look, there's a flow.
[75:20] Oh, yay. A flow. I like flows. Oh, okay.
[75:24] So. Okay.
[75:29] So let's see what we have over here. When you and I first talked,
[75:40] we started like what needs to be defined or worked on and then what have we defined?
[75:48] These I'm just keeping very separate because they're not fully thought out ideas or they're just things we kind of need to keep
[75:54] track. So I'm going to start with project definition.
[75:58] Which part of it is tracks. So then track ideas.
[76:04] Timeframe. Curriculum.
[76:08] And what is the output of going to be a ball of us? So, and this is definitely just a start, but like project definition.
[76:17] Great. And open source champion program. That's all I got for now.
[76:20] And I looked up examples just so that way. We're started.
[76:25] And then for track ideas. I put, you know, the tracks that we previously had.
[76:32] And then what do we want people to know beforehand? Just to put it somewhere because yes, this could go into curriculum,
[76:40] but I feel like it kind of goes into tracks, but. At least it's in there. I didn't add anything to it.
[76:46] Different tracks might have different, I guess, you know, that's kind of like.
[76:51] That also with your flow though, are you saying that? Like everything downstream. So like, okay, here's the project.
[76:57] And then we have a series of tracks. Right. And then the tracks have like their timelines and then, you know, so.
[77:04] This is just to like, the flow is just to get the ideas going. Yeah.
[77:09] And more organized. This isn't necessarily the full, like, this is exactly what we're doing yet.
[77:14] No, I definitely like what you have here. I might make two suggestions. So I like the kind of way you've broken it out.
[77:22] I would flip. Track and timeline, right? Have the program.
[77:27] Then have the timeline because we want all the tracks to basically look and feel the same. Right.
[77:32] We want them to be fairly modular and interchangeable. So I feel like we're kind of settling, honing in on this, like.
[77:38] Four week timeline, you know, for a track and then stringing different tracks together,
[77:43] kind of like doubling down on tracks, you know, a little bit, build your own adventure. Right.
[77:47] So we can design our tracks around that sort of timeline. And then.
[77:54] I think that that makes a lot of sense. Right. It's kind of like.
[77:59] The project is the pointy end of the triangle and it kind of goes outwards. Like, what are the timeframes? Right.
[78:06] Eventually timeframes will overlap with different cohorts. I'll be like, oh, you're part of the cohort.
[78:11] That's like done a few cycles. Right. You're part of the new cohort. Right.
[78:15] So it kind of multiplies around time. And then over time we're adding different tracks as well.
[78:21] What I like about your instinct was like, hey, here's the. The.
[78:27] Kind of base knowledge. I would put that by curriculum. Right. Yeah.
[78:32] That's kind of like where. We're going to get stuck is a lot of this overlaps.
[78:39] So that's why I had to move like what we were just talking about down so much because the timeline goes into the curriculum too.
[78:46] And so that's why this is just to get it on paper to talk about not yet fully defined or anything.
[78:53] Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Because we have like the current base idea of weeks.
[78:59] With kind of the curriculum, but we haven't built that out yet. All we know is.
[79:05] Maybe after, you know, Onboarding that they do these issues like we don't know yet.
[79:11] We don't know. So this is just to capture.
[79:16] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. That's why I move it around too much.
[79:21] I get what you're saying about the track ideas. I think that is very valid, but the rest of it,
[79:25] I don't want to move around too much. I just saw that little, you know, quick, quick kind of.
[79:31] Yeah, for sure. Because like we need to be creating part of the curriculum is like what
[79:37] week by week, like there's going to be a lot that goes into that. And then the output knowledge.
[79:43] And so now that we have this set up and it's very well set up to be able to talk to Weston next week when I talk to him.
[79:52] So that way we can kind of break down a bit better on what. Is going to be the structure and a week by week idea for you of what
[80:01] we're going to work on tackling that week. Yeah.
[80:04] No, that sounds awesome. I'm glad you're with Weston.
[80:08] I know he's been looking at a lot of like kind of volunteering for, for the non-tech sort of stuff with DA.
[80:15] He's been great in terms of helping structure projects like these. Right.
[80:21] Yeah. But this at least gets our ideas more on a page because something that I
[80:28] like about Miro, when we were talking about this compared to the other one is I couldn't
[80:32] fit all of this on one page. So it was really, really hard for me to conceptualize,
[80:37] keep it moving forward where now, even if I wanted to put like a Google doc in here or something I could
[80:45] on like being able to structure this afterwards, because that is one thing that I've definitely learned with project
[80:52] planning as well as like working with others is some people want it as an outline in a word doc.
[80:58] And some people like me need to have it all over as a scatter like. Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[81:05] But I find one leads to the other, right? Like the scatter, you know, what does structure the ideas.
[81:11] And then we can kind of, you know, as we, you know, take those different connections and, you know,
[81:15] move them out to their own subsection or whatever, more of a hierarchical, you know,
[81:20] kind of word doc or presentational format might appear. Right.
[81:24] Yeah. So that is where I'm leaving it for now.
[81:29] And that's all I got. Yeah.
[81:33] Now I feel good. I do a Thursday dinner party.
[81:36] So I got to get to get the laundry going, get the house clean. Did all the grocery shopping.
[81:43] Sorry again for being late, Jen. It's so great to see you all on the stream.
[81:47] Thanks for hanging out. And I hope you enjoyed the co-work with Jen and I today.
[81:54] Yes. And eventually I'm going to look at music, but for now,
[81:59] everyone on the teach Jen tech channel, I'm reading you over to Brandon Roberts,
[82:04] which is like a really dope human. So let me get that going.
[82:08] Thank you everyone. Bye.
[82:11] Thank you. Take care, y'all.
