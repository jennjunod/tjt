[00:00] Welcome to another episode of Teach Gen Tech, today being Teach Gen Next with Daniel Rowe. Daniel, who are you and what's next?
[00:10] Hi, it's really nice to be here. Who am I? I didn't expect to, you know, get into such in-depth sort of soul-searching just straight out of the box, but that was my joke. I'm Daniel,
[00:27] I live in the UK, I lead the Next team. Next is a framework for building web apps, it's a full-stack framework and it's designed for the edge. I've got three cats and a dog,
[00:45] I live on the shore of a river, and currently all day today it has been totally grey and rainy, and so I'm cosy inside, cosy inside. Good, good, and thank you for joining us today, and being back
[01:04] home after all of your travels, I know I just got back from New York, so I'm like, oh wait, I have to go back to normal now, like we're normal schedule, what is this?
[01:14] It's a totally different thing, isn't it? Sort of suddenly you're like, right, routines, routines. I actually have a routine, I like my routine, it works well, there are bits of it that
[01:27] I like. Lunch, I have, here's my, I don't think I've ever told anybody this publicly, but every day I have soup, I go make myself some soup and I have it in a mug, and I drink it. That is the
[01:44] level of home comfort that we're talking about. Totally easy, but incredible. That's my top tip for today. Nice, and what up parasocial? Okay, Daniel, what kind of soup? Is it the same soup
[02:00] every day, and is it homemade soup or canned soup, or the pre-made mix? I see I have opened a can of worms, or is that a tin of soup? I mean, are you having worm soup? I hope not, I very much hope
[02:16] not. No, it's different, it's almost, you know, I probably would not mind if it was the same every day, but I basically, it varies. Like today I had just tomato soup, but I sort of tipped half of the
[02:28] spice jar of chili in it, so it's very spicy tomato soup. Sometimes I might put like a little bit of a sort of basil or something on top of it, and that just sort of makes it a little bit nice.
[02:41] I like it. But it's so, so nice. So like, honestly, I'm sorry if I'm taking over about soup. No, no, I like learning about soup. I'm no expert, but it's just so, it's perfect when
[02:56] the weather is cold, and the clouds are gray, and it's raining outside, and just to be able to sort of sit back and look at a PR or something, and sort of gently sip your soup. It's very nice.
[03:10] It's, it's, that's, that's peak, peak life. That's, that's what I'm saying. I am just thinking about that, and where I live, it is about 47 degrees Celsius.
[03:23] For those in the US, that's about 117 degrees Fahrenheit, and I'm like, soup right now? I would not be able to do it. No, no, that is.
[03:36] I do, oh goodness, go ahead. No, I'm just saying that I completely agree. I have a frittata. It's a sweet potato, feta, spinach frittata almost every single day.
[03:58] I, you know, a frittata, like honestly, that is, okay, I'm going to be honest with you. So, like, it sounds, frittata sounds amazing, but the few times I've had them, they, they seem to
[04:12] have a lot of vegetables in them. That's my observation. That's why I only, yeah, that's why I only make it at home, is I'm way too picky about it if it's somewhere else.
[04:24] Yeah. I'm like, it's grown somewhere else. Is it potatoes and other stuff, and you can have sort of different hash type things in it? It's egg, sweet potato, spinach, feta, rosemary,
[04:43] and paprika. Because I think that could, I think that could persuade me. That does sound nice. That like, those sound like good things to be together. I don't know about the sweet potato,
[04:55] but I'm, I'm willing to be persuaded. It's so yummy. It's, and it's very easy to cook, and I make it, and it works like once every five days. Wait, what? What are shower oranges?
[05:11] Why have neither of you told me about shower oranges? Yes. Yes. Okay. So I'm so happy that I get, I get to be the one, like, you know, I, I feel that this is a significant moment in my life.
[05:25] I get to be the one to introduce you to shower oranges. Now, shower oranges, are, now, the, the, the concept is actually very simple, and you're going to just find this is
[05:36] crazy. But, and then I'm going to say one sentence, and immediately you're going to understand why. So a shower orange is an orange that you eat in the shower. And in your head, you're thinking
[05:49] that is ridiculous. Why would you eat an orange in the shower? And then I'm going to say one sentence, and the sentence is, it doesn't matter about the juice. You can just enjoy that orange,
[06:00] and just relish the orange, and it is totally okay. And shower peaches, probably equally good. Shower mangoes. You could have any number of different shower fruits. Can you just appreciate
[06:13] the freedom of having them in the shower? Is that, isn't that, isn't that actually, like, that's a mind-blowing concept. That's, like, once it's explained, this, this, it's not just me,
[06:25] right? This is, this is a good idea. I like the shower orange. I am iffy about the peaches, but I like to do my peaches in a bowl with, like, almond milk or something. So I'm,
[06:38] I'm picky about my peaches. But the, I get it. I get it. And, oh, geez. That's pretty funny. That is pretty funny. But how, okay. This is my other question. And for those who don't know,
[06:53] who's also in the chat is Josh, Josh, I can't even say your name again, apparently today. Josh Goldberg. There we go. Who has been on our show many, many times. We talk about learning
[07:07] TypeScript. So how does Nuxt and TypeScript go to shower oranges? Jen is like, we are going to talk about Nuxt today, whatever, soup, shower oranges,
[07:24] what's going on? Next we're going to be talking about, I don't know, semiconductors at room temperature or something like that. What does Nuxt and TypeScript have to do with shower oranges?
[07:35] I'm not sure there is an answer to that question. I feel like they are in separate planes of reality, except that they are both amazing. Maybe that, that's going to be my, my sort of link.
[07:47] Okay. I like it. I like it. Am I allowed to say that? Like I'm, I might not be allowed to say that. That might be sort of too, I might be too invested in it. I mean, I feel like you are pretty
[08:01] invested in shower oranges, but Nuxt, I feel like is newer for you than maybe shower oranges. I could be wrong, but. It's totally true. It's true. I, I think I, at some point I went to look on
[08:21] GitHub to find my first, the first ever issue that I, the first ever open source contribution I made to Nuxt, to anything Nuxt related. And it is actually not, I feel it's not that long ago.
[08:37] So basically I only started, I think open source contribution, actually this study is a little bit while ago now, time passes. It sort of seems like year after year, just basically, I don't
[08:50] think I, I don't think I made a contribution to Nuxt until, until 2019. So like to any, to any Nuxt repository, like a module or whatever. And I think in, I think that's right. I think, I think
[09:14] in 2019, I made some, I, that's when I really started. So that was like four years ago. I think that was when I got into, involved in, in, in, in the Nuxt community. And I mean, so shower oranges
[09:31] clearly came first, got it. But, no, actually, that's the thing. That, and that may be where my deep inner passion for shower oranges comes from, because I'm new, I'm new to them. So I am, I'm
[09:43] just discovering the delight. It was actually, I only found out about them on, on a GitHub call that GitHub did, had a little sort of round table on sort of open source maintainers, mental health.
[10:00] And we were just chatting about different sort of techniques. And I actually don't know how this came up, but someone brought up shower oranges. Was it Josh? I don't know. I don't
[10:12] know who it was, but someone brought up shower oranges. There's actually a whole subreddit devoted to shower oranges. I'm not, I'm not sure if that's still true, given the sort of things
[10:22] to do with Reddit, but there's a whole shower orange subreddit about people talking about shower fruit of different kinds. And so I discovered it just sort of fresh a few, few
[10:31] months or so ago. So I'm afraid my contributions to the shower orange cause are relatively recent. If anybody can link that subreddit, I feel like it's definitely going to be worth reading later on.
[10:44] And Josh, I'm going to go to yours first. Yes. Oh, ice matcha sounds amazing right now. I had so many matches while traveling lately. Yeah. Thank you, Daniel. And parasocial. Well, Daniel,
[11:05] did you have anything to do with naming NUXT? Um, parasocial is absolutely right. I did not have anything to do with naming it NUXT. I, um, I did not. So I, I, I, I, I, I'm a relative
[11:19] latecomer. So I came around, I think, uh, two, NUXT two was already out, I think. Um, and, uh, I think it was by the time I started using NUXT. Um, and no, I didn't name it. I mean,
[11:33] for those who are wondering, um, NUXT was a hat tip to next. Um, so next was one of the first frameworks, um, out there, JavaScript meta frameworks, um, doing a lot of cool things.
[11:44] So page-based routing, configuring web pack, and, uh, but doing it for react to the react ecosystem and not next came along to Sebastian and Alex Japan, um, came, they built basically what was
[11:56] originally a template for, for working with Vue. Um, and then basically it became a meta framework quite quickly, um, and lots of contributions, lots of contributors. Um, it, it grew very quickly.
[12:08] Um, it was named NUXT, I believe as far as I can tell, because of the letter U in Vue. So just as next with react and NUXT with Vue. Um, and it was, it was basically saying we're, we're like next,
[12:21] but for Vue, like a fun, a fun thing. So, uh, and then it's, it's still, yeah, NUXT, I think it's, I think it's a fun, fun name. I feel like this, this does bring up a good point of if anyone is
[12:35] wondering, like how Daniel ended up being on the show. Oh my gosh. It's almost been a year. August is closer to October than I thought it was. Okay. So October of 2022, I emceed,
[12:51] I think it was NUXT Nation and it was a great opportunity. And I knew not a lot about NUXT or Vue. I'm still learning a lot. And I was like in my head, barely understanding that meta frameworks
[13:06] are even a thing and like going, what is NUXT? What is Vue? I'm glad they're like writing these questions for me. Um, and I just want to say, in case anybody's curious, I also compared it to like
[13:19] hydration with quick at some point. And I was like, now I know they have nothing to do with each other. And that was probably a bad one, but you know, it was, it was a learning experience.
[13:31] And then you were in Vue Nation and I think Vue Forge, the last Vue Forge, right? That is all true. And you were great at NUXT Nation, by the way. I don't know what you're
[13:44] doing of that sort of, ah, now I know it's all very different. You were, you were fantastic. Well, thank you. Thank you. It's always fun because I get to ask a lot of random questions.
[13:53] And one thing that because of time restraints, I haven't been able to ask, but I would love to hear your version of it. Cause you started to talk about what the difference between
[14:06] NEXT and NUXT is, and I like that it's, uh, NEXT is to react as NUXT is to view, but can you explain a framework to a metaframework and why someone would use a metaframework?
[14:19] So, um, I guess, um, so I, yeah, of course. So, um, basically when we were talking about JavaScript frameworks, we're typically talking about, um, uh, something that helps manage
[14:36] reactivity, um, and user interface, um, in, in a browser. Um, it could mean a lot of things, but that's typically what we mean. So something like a React or Vue or Angular is basically,
[14:51] uh, helping developers more easily write code that translates to interactive user interfaces in a browser. So it, um, you can do things like say, um, the, the content of this, uh, bit of
[15:05] this div should be always the user's name. And then when you change the user's name, it reactively updates that. And so that, that kind of reactivity, that kind of declarative syntax,
[15:14] so you're not having to go in like document query selector, get the div, change the text con, you know, you're not having to do that. That is typically, I think what we mean by a JavaScript
[15:25] framework. So there are lots of them like solid, um, you know, Svelte, uh, React, Vue, um, lots and lots and lots, um, of, of great, great frameworks. And the meta framework builds on
[15:37] that. So just as the framework exists to abstract away the pain of writing your own, um, sort of jQuery and just sort of going and finding stuff and making it happen, um, a framework makes it
[15:52] simpler and better. Um, so a meta framework does the same. So it, it, it aims to take more pain away, um, for other things that you need to do. So often meta frameworks will handle like build
[16:04] tooling. So, um, originally the success of both next and next handled, uh, came from the fact that web pack was both wonderful, but also extremely painful to configure. And most people, um, getting
[16:17] started in web development today wouldn't have a clue because, um, as in thankfully won't have a clue because web pack was so bad. It was so hard to configure. It was such a good tool. Um, don't
[16:28] get me wrong. Um, that when you had a framework that would just handle that for you, it, it was wonderful. Um, and they would also do things, other things as well, like handle server-side
[16:38] rendering, which again was something that wasn't straightforward to get started. Um, they sort of had best various different best practices built in. They would handle things like also configuring
[16:49] a backend framework. Um, so that might be express or connect or something like that. And so basically a meta meta framework brings more goodies to the table. Um, but along the
[17:01] same kind of lines, like it's, you're, you're moving away from assembly code, uh, towards abstractions that work better for the work that you have to do. Um, and the challenge always,
[17:12] as you go up that, that sort of pyramid, um, Maslow's hierarchy or whatever, towards that, like the perfect, uh, developer experience, the challenge is how do you keep, um, have,
[17:24] have enough control because at every step where you have a sort of abstraction, something that makes your life easier, um, sometimes what, what if you want to get into the nitty gritty?
[17:34] And so a big part of what a good meta framework is from my point of view is do you have escape hatches that let you shimmy down the pole all the way down to the bottom of the pyramid to
[17:43] tinker with a few bricks and then get on a lift back up to the top again? If, if the, the, uh, the analogy hasn't completely, uh, I like it. I like it. And I think that's a good explanation
[17:56] of it. B before I ask you how you, uh, before I ask you about, um, what you would put into a full stack app if you were to build one, because I'm very excited about this question. How would you
[18:11] explain TypeScript? Because I feel like a lot of people and Josh, if you're still watching, I am purposely asking during somebody that does it all. Um, but it's, it can be confusing because
[18:26] of TypeScript doing a type system and people confusing that, uh, to like a meta framework. How would you explain TypeScript on top of all of that? So I would, um, I would say TypeScript
[18:44] is a way of, of annotating your code, um, to describe it's, um, what, what your code expects to, to receive and return in terms of, of, uh, the basic, uh, building blocks of the language.
[19:00] So things like strings and numbers and objects and things like that. So most of the time TypeScript doesn't actually change your code. Um, it only describes it better. So it enables you to, um,
[19:13] it enables your, your, your tooling, things like, uh, ESLint, Josh ESLint, um, or your IDE, like VS code, or even at like a build step to detect bugs, like, uh, so you're assigning a
[19:31] number to a string. And if you're going to call, um, a string method on it, it's not going to work. And so TypeScript by, by letting you annotate your code and by doing a lot of inference to sort of
[19:42] figure out, even when you don't explicitly say what something is, it basically gives you a better developer experience, um, by spotting bugs and, and adding that, that, that purely builds time
[19:55] developer experience, um, layer on top of things. TypeScript does have runtime elements to it. Most of the time I don't use them personally. I, I, I view it as mostly about improving the quality of
[20:08] the code you write at, at, um, at right time. I almost actually never use the actual emitted code that TypeScript, uh, emits. I just strip the type, type data, but I think it's a very, very useful
[20:21] build, build step tool. I like it. And, uh, Josh asks, I feel like this is just setting you up for success. What is ESLint? Um, setting you up for success and trolling are very closely related in
[20:43] this particular context. So, um, I think, so for those who may not know, uh, so ESLint is, is an amazing, um, way to also spot issues that may creep into your project or enforce certain
[20:59] standards of, um, code style. Um, so for example, you might want to say you always need to, uh, handle, um, uh, an error that might be thrown, um, by a promise, by an async await operation.
[21:13] And you can enforce that kind of thing with something like ESLint. Um, and the, uh, and so, so ESLint allows you to write these rules. It comes with lots of great ones built in. It understands
[21:24] TypeScript pretty much out of the box. Um, and, uh, it's a, it's a great tool. So I would say most projects that are around these days would be using ESLint. Um, so I hope that helps Josh.
[21:38] Um, actually, I can't, I can't believe I, like, this is probably a terrible explanation. Josh should basically jump in and be like, this is, Daniel, you've actually missed the main philosophical
[21:50] point of the ESLint. But that, that's how I sort of, that's how I sort of think of it. I love it. And for those who are curious and hello to all the writers. Thanks, Jason. Uh,
[22:06] because we are talking about, um, TypeScript and going through those differences as well. Josh has been on the show, a probably the most, maybe the most out of anyone, maybe. And, uh,
[22:24] so we have a learning TypeScript playlist for those who want to check it out. And it is very fun to troll and set up Daniel for success to talk about what TypeScript and ESLint are. So yes.
[22:40] And what up, uh, Jacob. Yay, Jacob. Jacob's been on the show too. Uh, when he first tried teaching me about what TypeScript was and it ended up being about, I think serverless, headless
[22:56] servers. I don't know. It was very, very early on and it was pretty funny because I could not understand it whatsoever. And then yeah, and Jason's been on the show. Lots of, oh yes,
[23:09] workers. Yeah. I feel like we shouldn't go in at one of these at one point, Jacob. We should go into work. I feel worker. Yes. Edge. Come on, Jacob. Like, I want to explain it,
[23:20] Daniel. We'll just go like go from Nuxt into edge edge serverless and workers. Cause I still, it's not clicking yet. Well, so basically Nuxt is written for this. So one of them,
[23:31] like one of the benefits that you get by opting into Nuxt is that you can compile it. So when you, when you run that build step, it builds for you. If you're deploying on Cloudflare,
[23:41] it builds for Cloudflare workers or pages or whatever your target is. Um, if you're deploying on something else like Deno, it builds for Deno. If you're deploying on Vercel, um, whether that's
[23:52] their edge or the serverless, it builds for that. So basically Nuxt is designed, um, for, for, for this. So workers is very much like, uh, like I, I, I, I love it. I'm, I'm all about that.
[24:06] Okay. So how would you explain, and this is something interesting. Um, uh, Ooh, that's a good question. Oh my gosh. These are fun questions. I'm enjoying this. I don't know
[24:17] about you, Daniel, but I'm enjoying this. Uh, how would you explain what edge is? I had this on, uh, uh, another episode, but I think that explaining what Cloudflare and edge
[24:31] does is another way of understanding what, um, workers do and being able, especially because there's so many terms for everything, which is very frustrating when, uh, we had somebody on
[24:45] for, um, analytics and talking about, uh, event logs and Pino Apache Pino there's words for the same words go for multiple things. It's very frustrating, but how would you explain it?
[25:02] Um, so I would say basically, I'm sorry, I didn't say what it actually was just that we supported. So basically I think, uh, edge is actually a confusing term. So, um, traditionally, I think
[25:17] edge really refers to a location. So edge means, um, not that you might have something like a central server. Um, if imagine you had your server, a single server, and it's in the center,
[25:29] and then you have lots of users connecting to it. Um, you have this, the sort of the closer you get to the user, the more on the edge you are of the sort of what that server is serving. Um, and so
[25:42] you can actually do in an, this is a super simplified and probably inaccurate explanation, but so edge is sort of near your users. Um, and when that, when it's not just a single server,
[25:53] but a whole network serving these kinds of requests, then you can actually have different layers. You can have like the thing that's, um, your server in the middle, but then you can have
[26:03] content delivery networks, for example, um, which actually have computers close to your users and those computers close to your users aren't actually processing the request, but they're
[26:12] doing things like caching data and sort of responding quickly with the responses where they can respond quickly. And then deferring to the central service inaccurate, but that
[26:23] they're deferring to the, um, something that's a bit further away to answer the request. And so when we're talking about moving stuff to the edge, what we're talking about is moving
[26:33] things away from centralized, um, locations that are further away from users to locations, which are like, uh, many and very close to like very close to the users. So instead of just having,
[26:47] you know, 10 regions across the world where your, your, your code runs, it might be in 50 or a hundred, like I, Jacob would be better able to get, tell me exactly how many, but like
[26:59] it would be in lots and lots of places. And one of the consequences that for me edges location, but when we talk about edge these days, we're mostly talking about a different format because,
[27:10] um, if you want to take code that was running in like a few places and actually run it in lots and lots of places, um, you need to make it small and fast so that it can actually respond to those
[27:25] requests, um, pretty instantly and not, not like you don't just want to multiply the central servers. You actually want just something that can quickly respond. And part of how we've done that these
[27:37] days in lots of providers from Dino to CloudFlare to, um, Lagon, uh, is basically to, to have not like a, a little mini Docker or, um, a sort of Lambda, which is you have a zip with node modules
[27:53] in it, but something even smaller, um, which is called V8 isolates. V8 is the engine that powers both node, uh, in, on your CLI and Chromium in the browser. Um, and it also powers these edge
[28:09] runtimes. So they're, they're basically little isolated environments where you can execute some code and those environments are often a lot like a browser. So instead of having access to things
[28:21] like the file system, they'll have access to things like a request and response object or a native fetch method and things like that. So, so this is a super, super long explanation, but, but
[28:34] I would, I would say edge is a way of describing location. Worker, a worker environment is a way of describing the kind of, um, environment that is, that is running your code. And, but typically
[28:48] they get like combined. So when we talk about Nuxt running on the edge, um, we are talking about it supporting this worker environment, which enables it to be deployed to the edge location.
[29:00] Um, so it's what's lots of different sort of locations and sort of other frameworks too. Um, but I think this is a really, really nice move. So, um, and, and, and great pressure. So
[29:13] the, this move from like a single server that runs for a long time and processes lots of requests was very tolerant of things like, um, slow start, uh, because it didn't matter because you only
[29:27] started at once and then it sort of lasted for forever. But with this V8 isolate thing, these edge networks, they don't have everybody's code running all the time because actually they
[29:37] need to just fire it up quickly to respond to individual requests that are coming in. And so it has to be super fast to start. So for example, when we move from Nuxt 2 to Nuxt 3,
[29:47] we completely rewrote the framework. I mean, it, it, I'm not sure there's a line of code that's the same. And so in, in Nuxt 2, the cold start, the amount of time it took to,
[29:57] after you ran the code to start Nuxt was about 300 milliseconds, um, to start the server. Now 300 milliseconds is a third of a second. It's not that long, but it's very long
[30:10] if you're adding that to a request. So if someone is making a request, um, it basically like that, that's going to mean you're at least, you're probably going to be a second, you know, it's
[30:20] going to, it's going to feel like a long response. Nuxt 3 is one millisecond. So it's 300 times faster than Nuxt 2. Um, and it doesn't, I mean, obviously your mileage might vary. That's just
[30:33] my laptop. Um, but that means that, oh, and there are, there's other things that add to it. So like your actual network request, there'll be DNS resolution. So it matters that you have a good,
[30:44] good name servers and so on. It's um, like if you're deployed, if you're on a serverless environment like AWS or Vassil and Netlify have serverless environments as well as edge runtime
[30:56] ones, um, you'll also have to sort of download, um, and unpack a zip file that has your code in it. So like all of these things add milliseconds. The bit that I'm talking about is just one part
[31:07] of it. Uh, and then you also have the amount of time it takes to respond to the request. Um, and, uh, and then, and then send it back. So like there's lots of different components in,
[31:18] in there, but one of the significant ones from the point of view of what we have control over as a framework, um, is that amount of time it takes to start the code. Um, and so moving from
[31:30] like 300 to one millisecond is a big deal for us. Um, and one of the things is that we dynamically load, uh, the code in as required. So actually we don't know the code that isn't needed. Um,
[31:43] and at the moment, that's something that is actually missing on Cloudflare, but not, it is now supported, um, as in it had been missing for a while, but it is now supported,
[31:51] which is a really delightful thing to, to, to hear. So hat tip to you, Jacob. Okay. That definitely was a lot to take in yet. It did make sense yet. I think the part
[32:05] that I am slightly still a little stuck on is, so it makes sense that edge is from my understanding further away and, but workers are closer or am I backwards?
[32:24] I'm sorry about that. Um, that's, it's on me probably for using these two terms. Typically edge and workers are the same. So, um, the edge is the location and the worker,
[32:35] um, worker environment is typically used on the edge. So typically they are the same. They don't have to be so, so, um, you can have a different kind of environment that's running in that same
[32:47] location, but, but for me, I don't know, Jacob saying no in the comments, I don't know what that means, but like for me, um, edges, the location and a worker environment is a kind of
[32:58] code environment, like a runtime. Um, you have a node runtime, you have a browser runtime, you can have web workers, you can have different kind of, um, service workers and so on. But that
[33:08] worker kind of environment, um, is, is often used on the edge. And so typically when people are talking about a deployment target, they're talking about deploying target to the edge,
[33:21] which is close to your users. But, um, yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm letting that noodle. And then also my dog is barking nonstop in the background. Does your dog, does your dog want to come? Like,
[33:37] what kind of dog do you have? I have a golden retriever. Oh, she is a bulldog pit bull mix. And she is an old lady that cannot hear anymore. She turns 13 next month.
[33:52] So she cannot hear. So I can't even yell at her. Like I'd have to go find her. I mean, it's not hard. She's very, what up Bakari? And thank you everyone for joining
[34:04] and being a part of our discussion about next, which ended up talking about edge and workers. And there's a lot that goes into it. We've also discussed TypeScript and ESLint.
[34:20] I explained it to Josh. It was important that he understand he was a bit confused. It seemed about TypeScript and then ESLint just came into the mix. It was important.
[34:28] Yeah. And I felt like you were just doing the same for, you know, what CloudFlare does and workers. And thank you. Thank you for the explanations. Um, and Lerner asked a question of
[34:44] serverless means you delegate everything to hosting your hosting and run a small individual functions where your hosting provider takes care of scaling out.
[34:55] It's a pretty fair, um, definition of it. Exactly. So of course there's still servers, but you're not really concerned with, uh, provisioning the server. Um, you're not
[35:07] concerned with scaling the servers. What you're concerned about is your code. And so mostly with serverless you have, you'll have your dependencies, you'll have your code
[35:16] and they'll take care of like firing it up, scaling it, running it. Um, it's, uh, it's like a bit like, so yeah, you then can have something like Docker, which is more than that.
[35:32] Um, it doesn't really count as serverless in my book, but it's, it's still, you know, it can be scaled and you can have providers who will basically do that with your, your Docker
[35:41] images. Um, and then you can have, you know, full server where you are actually managing it. You've got Ansible or Terraform or something like that. Um, or, or you've got sort of elaborate Kubernetes
[35:51] deployment, uh, strategies. And honestly, um, if you don't have to deal or think, think about that, then that's probably a win. Uh, for edge workers, uh, you sort of have to
[36:06] uh, have that for your users, nearest regions for performance. And Jacob said education, edge location, not education, edge location. Yes. Okay. Okay. You
[36:24] guys, I'm going to pause on these ones because now you guys are going on a, like going way above my head and I'm getting there. I am getting there, but it's, I've only been doing this for a little
[36:35] over a year and have gone to specifically focusing mostly on backend and learning data infrastructure. So, but I still am like, Oh, go ahead. No, no, sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
[36:50] You're good. You're good. I, I definitely feel like it's something that we were talking about this before we started streaming of how complicated all this can be to learn. Like you also need to
[37:05] learn. And, uh, as many of, you know, practicing and actually doing it myself instead of just theory, because I can get the theory, but then I actually need to code it. It's been a lot of fun,
[37:14] but it can be very difficult to understand what all of these go into. And before I go a bit more into next, I'm curious if you were to build a full, uh, full stack app, what tech would you use?
[37:32] What would your tech stack be? Ooh, that is a good question. Um, but I mean, I, and, and I will answer it, but I mean, I do completely agree with what you said about how complex some of this is,
[37:44] like, I mean, because I think thinking about this, I mean, I I've sort of picked bits up here and there over a little while, like, this is really tough. If you're just suddenly thinking I am,
[37:57] I must understand everything. And you've got like, um, like even next, you know, it's it's okay. It runs on node and development. It runs on no JS runtime, which is, you know, in the command line,
[38:09] you have to understand what's going on in the command line in the node and node environment, but it actually can deploy to different environments. And under the hood, it uses V to
[38:17] build your code, which uses roll up under the hood to build your code. And so you have plugins, which can do all kinds of different things. And obviously your deployment target is going to run
[38:24] in a different different environment, you have to understand a little bit about that. We use nitro as a server framework to compile everything and run it and you have to understand things about
[38:33] request and response handlers. You might also have to or want to understand things about the node request and response object. You might also want to understand you know, what's going on with with
[38:43] stuff, you know, in your in your node modules, and how dependencies work and some of the different things that are involved. And it's phenomenally complex. Like it's it's not it's not an easy
[38:55] thing if you're trying to, I mean, I don't want anybody to have to know any of that to use next. But if you but the moment you start digging, like it's hard, like to understand everything that's
[39:06] going on in web dev. I mean, we have it very, we're very fortunate in lots of ways, we don't have to write webpack and fix anymore. But there's a lot to grasp, for sure.
[39:18] Sorry, you was you were asking tech stack. So, and I really think I think it depends a little bit on what you're building. I think there are a lot of good choices out there.
[39:28] I can, rather than say an ideal tech stack, I can tell you I built one, a little SAS app last year, which I haven't launched yet, because I haven't had time to make it look nice enough. But I built
[39:44] and I built that on, I used next for the app, I built, I use super base for authentication and data in real time database updates. I used Stripe to handle billing. I used, I think I use send grid
[40:07] at the time to handle programmatic transactional emails. I used, and I think I deployed it to Vercel. And the whole thing, it works. At some point, I'd need to launch it. But honestly, I
[40:19] would, I personally, I like picking different things. So I like not always going for the same one. Because it's better, I feel like sort of get familiarity with different things that are out
[40:32] there rather than always sticking to the same thing. Thank you. And even what Jacob said in the chat, there's also so many different people are going to have different tech stacks can make
[40:51] something similar. And when you're starting out, at least from my experience, I'm not necessarily going to be seeing a ton of difference with building a simple app using, if it's going to be
[41:07] milliseconds or anything like that for runtime, because I'm not going to be building a big enough app to really notice these things. Yet something that I have found very valuable is when you have,
[41:23] when you build a community and you're part of a community, using tribal knowledge is something that is so valuable and be able to get answers. So like with Jacob's community, we are the OSRG
[41:40] Discord. And they mainly do things in React and the T3 stack that Theo talks about a lot. And it's easier to get questions answered if I'm using something from there. Where if I'm doing
[41:59] something with Vue or Nuxt, there's the Vue School Discord, there's the Nuxt, there's like so many different ones. And Vue, trying to think of all of the discords that are there too, that to get
[42:14] the answers there. So it's for myself, if somebody were to be like, "Yo, which ones would you use?" I like using the ones that make the most sense and have the most community.
[42:25] And also when I have, like, I haven't touched Svelte at all. I'm like, "Svelte, I know it's a word. It's a thing. I'll get to it maybe someday." Yet it's not as popular. It doesn't mean
[42:40] it's bad. But, and yes, Jacob, lots of TypeScript. Everything is TypeScript. Josh has been here. You're here. Like everybody loves TypeScript. Don't worry.
[42:50] Oh, by the way, just to throw in a plug, we have a Nuxt Discord server, which is 100% where I would recommend coming to ask questions if you are wanting to build a Nuxt project.
[43:02] Yes. Yes. Just, no, I'm not for you, Jocelyn. I know you know, but.
[43:08] I thought I said it. Did I not say it? Because I meant to. You probably said it, yeah.
[43:12] I said it in my head. I think you said it. I think you said it. Yeah.
[43:18] And yes, Daniel was on Rizal's stream and will be on Nick's stream tomorrow. This is actually a big reason. He was on Rizal's stream and I was like,
[43:33] "I've, like, hung out with you during conferences, like, three times and I haven't had you on the stream yet." So I was like, "You need to come on my stream too." And that does bring up a great
[43:45] question that I loved how you went into this on Rizal's stream with GitHub, was how did you get into using Nuxt and into the technical fields? Because a lot of people, and I feel like teachers
[44:00] are a huge part of this in the U.S. at least, because, like, trying to find better jobs and opportunities. How did you get into Nuxt and being where you are today?
[44:12] So I, it's a good question. So I, it's a long, so basically when I was a kid, I taught myself to program Visual Basic just for fun. And sort of, I enjoyed computers. So I had Linux. And I
[44:32] remember sort of getting different little CDs of different Linux distros and trying them out. So I sort of could, I knew my way around a bit. So I would write, when I went to university,
[44:44] they had this wonderful library of classical music. But it could be downloaded. So I wrote a Perl script to download it all and listen to it on my computer offline. So things like that
[44:58] were really useful, just tools. But I didn't really, I studied, I didn't study it. I studied law, which was great. Enjoyed that. Studied theology. Actually worked for a church for a
[45:13] number of years. And then I started a creative agency. And gradually we needed to deliver more digital products. It was a message agency. We focused on clarity of communication, figuring
[45:25] out how to communicate what was special or unique about a business. But we needed to deliver some projects. So I started doing design work. I started building websites. And initially in WordPress.
[45:39] But then more and more, we tried to sort of make it more sort of modern WordPress stuff like Roots, using Laravel-inspired technology. And then through Laravel, I discovered Vue.
[45:53] And then one day I said, "Hey, we're switching. We're switching. We're going to build this next product in Nuxt," which I had just found out about. And that was basically how we discovered
[46:02] it. I switched my agency to Nuxt. My lead dev did not like it when I told him that's what we were going to do. And then I just started contributing. So as we started doing things, we built, I then
[46:15] pivoted into SaaS and built an app for a SaaS startup, which I then acquired called Parent Scheme. And we built that in Nuxt and basically contributed that way. So I just did it because I
[46:32] enjoyed it. And then when I decided to shut down Parent Scheme, or actually a little bit before that, I had joined the core team. But when I decided to shut down, basically, Sebastian pretty
[46:44] quickly said, "Hey, what do you think about sort of full-time doing open source?" And that was the start of some exciting things. That's about two years ago now.
[46:54] Yay. What were you using before you switched to Nuxt? Before Nuxt, I was using Vue just on its own in the browser, sort of raw template strings,
[47:07] runtime compiler, Vue loaded from a CDN, that kind of thing. Jess is here. Hey. What up, Jess? How's it going? Yes. And Jess will be on the show eventually too, to talk
[47:25] about Vue stuff, Vue and things. And for those who don't know, if you ever decide to do a late night stream where it's like coworking, but everyone else is bullshitting and you're stuck
[47:40] on CSS, Jess may join your stream to talk you through it and help you on CSS. That is how I met Jess. And yes. So five years ago. Okay. That makes sense on your timeline too, on getting into
[47:59] Nuxt and your first issue that you submitted. That's exciting. Five years ago. Crazy. And you are welcome to lurk, Jess. This is the
[48:14] fun part about TeachGenTech is you're not going to be forced to be in the conversation. Well, sometimes if you're like Josh and Jacob, then maybe you'll be forced into the conversation.
[48:27] All right. Something edge, edge, something. Yes. TypeScript. All right. So we talked a lot about how you got into this, a lot of more
[48:44] theory on like the differences between a framework and a meta framework and TypeScript, ESLint, Edge, CloudWorkers, how you got into this and also about NuxtNation, VueNation, VueForge,
[49:05] and another VueForge is the next two days, which y'all should come hang out. Cause I'll be emceeing and it'll be fun and it's free. And it's with VueSchool. I do love, like if people don't know
[49:20] what VueForge is, it is totally worth saying because it is an, I think it's one of the best formats out there. So it's a free event. You learn to build something. So you can, you basically code
[49:32] alongside lots of other people, lots and lots of other people. There are periodic talks from people who talk through how they built different bits of it. And things like, and as well as other kind of,
[49:50] there are mentors you can approach and ask for advice. Like the whole thing feels like fantastic fun to me. Like I would totally be up for that. Yay. Thank you. And the one that we're
[50:02] doing the next two days is going to be building code with blockchain, learning about crowdfunding and discovering web three more. And yeah, Daniel answered your question. So that made it easy.
[50:21] Yep. Although you can do certain parts of Astro with specific meta frameworks, correct? I think so. I haven't built on Astro in a minute.
[50:37] What do you mean? You can use Astro to do things or you mean you can do the things that Astro does in other frameworks? I would say both, because I think you can use other frameworks within Astro
[50:49] as well. So Astro supports more than, so, you know, for example, with Nuxt, you're just using Vue. Astro supports different ones. You could have Vue, React, Solid, Svelte. I think it supports
[51:02] all of them. But it is a meta framework like Nuxt. So Nuxt is a static site generator as well. And so is Astro. So they're both in the same kind of space of something built on top of other
[51:17] frameworks. I would have said, but maybe not. Okay. I like it. I think it's a good explanation. I am commenting Astro just so that way y'all can see that. But also if,
[51:33] I don't know what we might build, but I'm totally down to see if I can install it. Let's see if I can actually install Nuxt and use it. And I'm just going to Nuxt.com. I'm going to share my
[51:46] screen. I don't know what I'm going to build. We're just going to see how easy it is to actually install. And I will say this, because y'all, I haven't done this in a minute. I've been very
[51:57] focused for work for a while that I haven't even, like, touched this stuff. But for NPX, I can use NPM instead. Right? I would think. I think. >> NPX will execute it directly from NPM. So
[52:15] this means you don't need to install anything before running the command. So I think it is NPM, but it's just the executable bit of it. >> I was going to, oh, I guess I could paste
[52:28] this. >> Sit on the edge of my seat and watch, see what happens. >> Yes, we will install the
[52:34] following packages. Because I definitely didn't do this at all. Yeah, what are all the conferences you've been going to, Daniel?
[52:54] >> So, well, I don't think, it's not been too many. But there are a few coming up. But just recently, I was at the We Are Devs World Congress in Berlin. World Congress. I mean, that sounds
[53:10] like insane. And it was huge. It was, there were 10,000 people. You'll run NPM or PNPM. >> I skipped lines, which nobody will be surprised about here. Let me change screens so it's easier
[53:30] to see. I am really bad about skipping lines. I try not to. I really do. It happens. I'm not the best at it. Not skipping lines. And how was the conference? Did you do a talk at it
[53:53] or did you attend? >> I gave a talk about, I built Nuxt from scratch. Or something less than Nuxt. But sort of similar in concept. And that was fun. That was a
[54:11] lot of fun. But I mean, there was huge numbers of people. It was in some ways overwhelming. So there were like 10,000 people at the conference. But obviously lots and lots of tracks.
[54:20] So there were people constantly. And huge numbers of exhibitors. It just felt, it was a huge, huge thing. But I often struggle with it. I love conferences because I like meeting people and
[54:33] talking to people and finding out what other people are doing and what cool things are out there in the world. The, yeah, Matt, that's right. It's not quite as sketchy as the title.
[54:50] But with 10,000 people, you can feel a little bit overwhelmed in some ways. Because what I want, I want connection. I want people that I get to know and actually like. And for so much, for me,
[55:05] when I go to places, I meet people that I actually know because they've been, I've seen them, we've talked on Discord or they've contributed somehow. Or we're in the same circles or Twitter
[55:17] or whatever. And there were actually great opportunities to meet people there. Even though it was so big. And actually have some nice conversations too. So I would guess you are
[55:29] tethered to your mobile phone based on some of those networks that are popping up. But maybe not. Actually, no. Well, I mean, they're all on the same network.
[55:43] I don't know. Interesting. But we got to look how easy it was. I think that's one of the scariest things is installing from the first time. And just so that
[56:01] way people can see a bit more of what I did. In case you've never installed any of these before or not as familiar with it, is when you go to like Nuxt.com, you can install the framework
[56:17] and get started with an app by majority of the sites like this or Astro will have the copy. And once you're in the folder you want to go to, that is what I did at the very beginning. And then we
[56:35] went into the app itself. And did the NPM install. And voila. We did the NPM run. Which let us look at the actual site. Which is this one. Yay. >> Just to say, if anyone else is looking to start
[56:57] a new app. And I didn't tell you this, Jen. But there's another site as well which you can access from the header. If you go back to the Nuxt website, you should see a drop down on the Nuxt
[57:06] logo at the top. And if you click that drop down, there's also Nuxt.new. And on that site, it will basically give you the same command. But it will also give you, if you scroll down, a range of
[57:18] other starters that let you start with some other templates. And there are also, if you click the link at the top of the page, to themes. You can also start with some themed projects. So those
[57:33] are, Nuxt has the ability to sort of have a theme that you can install. And then you write all your own code. But it's themed that way. And it might inject components or composables into your thing.
[57:45] And so those are a few themes. So those are just some other ways people might want to get started if they want to get started. - When did this come out? Because I think this is newer than last time
[57:56] I looked at Nuxt. - Yeah, well, I think one of the main things that's happened is that we've linked to it. So it came out, I think it's been, it's probably about a year ago that we first built
[58:10] Nuxt.new. But we've only just, we actually redesigned it and rebuilt it. And now it's, and linked to it. And there's also another one. If you go to the top, you can click
[58:22] Nuxters. And this was a fun thing. Someone said this on the Discord, and I basically quickly built a proof of concept. And Sebastian and some of the Nuxt Labs team have sort of rebuilt it.
[58:33] But if you connect with GitHub, it will pull in how many pull requests you've made to Nuxt or NJS and issues and comments and things like that. And you can get a special role in the Nuxt Discord
[58:44] if you want. That was quite fun. - I'm excited about this. I, and I feel like this wasn't quite out with the Nuxt Studio, right? Did I? - Nuxt Studio is, so Nuxt.studio is the website. And
[59:10] that is a commercial product, which is being built by Nuxt Labs. So Nuxt Labs is a company. It's founded by the same people who created Nuxt, so Sebastian and Alex Chopin. But it's not a
[59:25] project of Nuxt. So Nuxt is an open source independent framework. But Nuxt.studio is a commercial product. It's great. It looks fantastic to me. It's a sort of Git-based CMS
[59:39] with a GitHub integration. So you have previews, like branch previews, and even works on GitHub pages for giving you branch previews, even though you don't, it doesn't deploy them. You can still
[59:51] actually preview the changes on your live site, which is a lot of fun. So, but I think it's currently, you have to sign up for access right now. It's a wait list, but they are letting people
[60:02] in all the time. - I signed up quite some time ago and I'm like, I wonder if I actually got into it or not, but I'm not quite sure. - Have you not got in? - I don't know. - I can poke Sebastian.
[60:17] Like, come on, Sebastian, let Jen in. - Maybe, maybe. I don't remember. I know that I've become like so drowned in work that I've like, and moving. I moved states about a month ago. And so I'm like,
[60:31] I kind of fell off the edge of the world. I was like, I forget the rest of the, everything that's going on. So I'll have to look into it. But for those who have not looked into a Next app and
[60:45] doing the install, we didn't do it with a theme. I'm so sorry if y'all can hear my dog. I'm hoping she stops soon. - Not today. - But it's, you can go in here and being able to look at all the
[60:59] different options and let's see, I actually haven't gotten, okay, here we go. It's actually not too like different. This is fun. It's my first time looking at it y'all. So that's why I'm like,
[61:12] I don't know where anything is. - So that folder, that .next folder is all generated stuff. And it's mostly for telling your editor, your IDE, like what is available in the next environment. So
[61:23] you shouldn't really need to get into it unless you want to. The main entry point for you is app.view. So everything that is currently displaying in your site is in app.view.
[61:32] And by the way, I love your editor theme. Like it feels quite fun. Yeah, I would definitely install that. Voila, which is also powering WebStorm now for view and also some other languages too.
[61:48] So basically if you were to get rid of Next, that Next welcome component there and just type something or type, put some HTML, then that is going to show up in your browser the moment you
[62:01] save that. - The most exciting I know. Ah, go back. Oh, I gotta redo it. - Ah yes, the dev server does
[62:19] need to be running. - Yeah, that does have to happen. Oh, hey, it works. That's exciting. - Yay, yay. Oh, now at the bottom of the page, you can see Next DevTools. So if you click that,
[62:34] you can basically now go and click any element in the page and it will take you back to like show you where that came from. - Oh, that's cool. - Yeah, it's not bad. So you can basically click
[62:45] to go back to the source and you can actually, is that working for you? - No. - Not yet. - Doesn't mean I'm clicking it right. - Oh, maybe you have to get started. Anyway, if you click
[63:01] that little mountain on the left, the Next logo and then say, yeah, I'm happy to get started. What's happening now? - I don't, I don't know. I broke it. There we go. - There it is. Okay.
[63:11] - Oh, when you click the thing to select, it hides the DevTools so you can see underneath it. That's what's going on. But do you click get start or yeah, or just go straight? And there are lots
[63:21] of different... - Stop clicking stuff. This is like the story of my life. Everybody tells me, Jen, stop clicking stuff. - Don't stop clicking stuff. Clicking stuff is basically how anybody
[63:31] ever discovers anything. Like that's how I know half of the things or anything that I know is because I click stuff. So like always click stuff. So I think, yeah, but there are lots of different
[63:40] little things you can explore in there. - This is cool. - So it will sort of expose a lot of information. There won't be any pages because we just have the one app that view, but like if you
[63:51] click in modules, for example, the one which is, we need to get like text so you can see them, but that one, you can install a new module. And this is how you, one of the unique things about
[64:04] Nuxt as opposed to Next, for example, is that we have like a really extensive, it's really extensible. So you can pick some kind of integration that you want to have in your app
[64:13] and it has full control of Nuxt. And we expose lots of different ways you can integrate with it. So you can pick, these are all, a lot of these are community modules. People can submit their
[64:25] modules to be listed in our API. And then it gets pulled down into things like DevTools and listed on the website as well. And if you just click, pick something and click, you can see some details,
[64:37] just click there. And, oh, this is for security. If you go back to your terminal, you have to click a link so that it makes sure that it's not some like nefarious person trying to install
[64:53] something on your operating system. You did a Google search for it. If you go and put it again and yeah, that should be, no, no, no. I think maybe there's a space at the beginning. Maybe
[65:17] that's why it's doing the search. See if you can backspace. Oh, okay. The two columns at the beginning, you can change that to localhost. Backspace, backspace, and then localhost.
[65:32] This is not as seamless as it should be, but you only have to do it once. And then your computer. Okay. So if you go back, if you go back to the original tab, then you can cancel that and restart
[65:52] the installation again. This is a little bit of a pain. Try it again, form kit, hopefully. So it's going to install the module and then add, like configure it in your next config. So you can just
[66:02] click the install button in the bottom, right. And hopefully that's going to install it. Fingers crossed. There you go. There's the terminal. And I think next is probably just restarting in the
[66:17] background. So yeah, it's installed. You have a new module. It's enabled. If you go and look in your next config, it's already set up there for you. And. Okay, this is fun. Y'all need to
[66:34] do this. This is great. That was a lot of fun. So there's stuff like, and there are other integrations to whatever like CMS you want to do, but you can see some of the things that next
[66:46] exposes. There are 125 built-in composables that are available. And you can see those, you can see which ones are being used in your app. The ones in white are actually being used. Those are being
[66:56] used by next itself, but you can also use some of yourself. And some packages that you install on modules will add their own composables. And this is a good way of seeing them. And actually
[67:07] some of them will also add documentation in the dev tools. You can see the docs right there when you're using stuff, but honestly explore it. There's lots and lots of stuff in there to see.
[67:17] You can click that enable routing button there to enable it at the moment. If you just have one file, which is app.vue, which serves everything, but if you click enable routing, it'll create a
[67:28] pages directory for you. And it might reload or something. I'm going to happening in your, go back to your ID and did it do anything? It might've done something. Yeah, it created
[67:45] a pages directory. And so all you then need to do in your app.vue is put a next page. I've actually added next page for you. That's great. So you can actually just go back to your browser
[68:01] and refresh. And I think you should see now a, just hit refresh at the top of the page. And it's possible you might have to restart your dev server.
[68:23] You won't after 3.7 comes out tomorrow, but it's possible you have to. Nothing like having you on like the day before. Yay. And it's set up.
[68:40] Cool. So, and there's, there's so, and now you can click into the page and you can see stuff like how your routes are trans, like match the pages. So this is like, this is the route
[68:54] you can then navigate between them. You can have middleware that's going to control whether people can access certain pages or not. And this basically exposes all of that.
[69:02] So you can see and explore it. You just got one. Can you drag and drop your assets in here too, or you still have to go through the IDE? Somehow I feel you can't, but it's a good idea. Like we
[69:15] should add that as a feature request. And honestly, Anthony, Anthony Fu is sort of leading development of the dev tools and he is phenomenal. So like pretty much if you suggest that that would be a
[69:26] nice idea, it would probably happen. Pretty soon. It might already do it. I don't know. We could check. We could try it really quick. Let's see. Why not? You know, let's see if it gives us an,
[69:39] I don't even know. Oh, like learning TypeScript. Oh, this is the. Oh, it does. It does. Click upload. Yay.
[69:55] This is very exciting, y'all. I like this. Okay. And then I am just going to go back and it is. Okay. Y'all, this is really cool. Like if this is like somebody's first project,
[70:15] this dev tool makes it so much easier to learn. Like, just like getting stuck on stuff when we were going, let me go here.
[70:26] Did you hit it? Oh, no. Go here. Like this. Like this is so cool. Because then you know what to go fix. I'm not quite sure why that isn't
[70:38] opening in your browser. I think it must be a regression. I think it's because at least when I'm looking at it, I think that I have to go click on the
[70:50] information right here. When I clicked on the text itself, it did open. Yeah. And that's, that'll be it. So that actually takes you to the line in the file
[70:59] that corresponds to the bit on the screen that you're clicking. So like if you're joining a big project, you know, it's not just a new project. If you're joining a big project with lots of
[71:10] components and it's a bit confusing, what's what, this can help you immediately find like, I want to fix that. I want to change that. I'm going to click it and it will take me to it in
[71:18] my editor. And I now know how to like where, where to make a change. I'm very much enjoying this.
[71:28] This is so fun. Yay. This is just like happiness. Okay. I'm going to have to build something y'all. And like, this is, this is fun. I'm
[71:46] having a lot of fun just with the tooling too. Oh, this is awesome. Oh, what's that? That that's what I'm going to end up doing is like, what's that? What's that?
[71:59] Oh, this is fun. This is fun. Okay. So start tracking. Now, basically I'm not sure it's going to do a massive amount because you have no code in the app, but what it will do, let's go and
[72:16] put some stuff in your, in your, in your app. Okay. So maybe let's see what, what should we do? If you let's, let's just create a function. Okay. We've only got one page. So the only
[72:36] thing we can do is like add a query string. This is the simplest thing. So if you go up into your script setup at the top, just under const root equals use root,
[72:44] let's just write a function. So we'll say function go somewhere. Remind me how to write that one. Just make that one lowercase, just lowercase function. And then
[73:01] space like one word go somewhere. And then like a pair of parentheses and then some curly braces, the curly braces on the other side of the parentheses.
[73:16] And then inside the curly braces, I'm sorry, I'm saying curly braces, but that might be a totally strange way of talking about it. Just type navigate capital T O, sorry, the navigate
[73:36] will be lowercase. So lowercase N and then capital T O and then like parentheses brackets and inside the parentheses put a string, which is forward slash.
[73:57] Sorry, with, with the quotes, you're, you're right. And then forward slash, and then just like a test equals true.
[74:07] Like, obviously you wouldn't do this. And then in your code, like you can just say, like put a button and so go under like the P tag there that says current route and just say,
[74:23] like put a button element in and the button can just have some text, like go, go somewhere. And then in view, the way you will make that button do what the, like do the,
[74:43] the function is if you go back into the button and just into the element a bit, so just between button and the angle bracket, do at click. So like, no, no, the other one,
[74:56] where you were, the other one. Okay. So just space and then at click equals quotation mark, and then go somewhere, just the name of the function.
[75:10] And probably it will probably not want the, the parentheses, although it might work. I just don't know a hundred percent. No.
[75:24] What up Christian? Okay. Okay. So if you now click the button, so, okay. It is the 404 because I guess that page doesn't exist, but what you'll see in this
[75:40] tracking thing is that you can actually see all the functions that have been called all the way along the way. And if you click them. Oh, that's cool. When it was called,
[75:52] where the stack trace of the thing that called the function was and the arguments that it accepted, like click, click, navigate to, and you can see the string that was passed to that function.
[76:04] And it was called from index.view. And basically this tracking tool injects this. So you have this for your whole app, where you can actually see like timeline of what is being called, where,
[76:17] what are its arguments? And it's quite a useful debugging tool. So, and that obviously is the use route, which is in the, in the page.
[76:29] This is really cool. And I like that you can do the pages here too. I wonder, wanting to see. Okay. Let me go back. Current route. All routes.
[76:45] Great. Okay. It opened it. This is really cool. I know I'm just kind of clicking around seeing what happens yet at the same time, I'm really liking. Okay. That was fun. Being able
[77:05] to just go back to the homepage from here. This is okay. I'm feel like I need to come, like figure out something to build here now, because I'm like, I just want to build something.
[77:17] Yes. I'm so glad. I'm like, this is fun. This is a lot of fun. Okay. Well, I feel like I've got my homework set up for me and I'll be doing all next in view stuff the next two days,
[77:31] which is exciting. Any questions y'all or anything, Daniel, you think we should look at before we start wrapping up? Well, I mean, I totally agree. I think that clicking around is the best
[77:50] way to learn anything. At least that for me, I'm totally a clicker around. Oh, that, by the way, that's how you just looked at allows you to run VS code inside your browser. And you can actually
[78:04] make changes to your website inside your website. But it's a little bit more complicated to set up. It's still an experimental feature within VS code. There's also one more thing. There's like
[78:19] a picture in picture mode where you can actually detach the Nuxt dev tools from, oh yeah, you can click open graph and actually see what it will look like. Your website will look like in search,
[78:31] which it doesn't have any, you've not put any. Oh, I like this. I like this a lot. This is, this is happiness. But it'll tell you it's missing, like you need a title, you need whatever.
[78:42] But you can also, yeah, picture in picture, I think is that, is it the next one? You definitely have to do a lot of exploring of icons. No, it must be, it's an experimental
[78:57] option. I think you have to probably enable it in the settings, which might be somewhere there. I might not have access. It's, it's okay. I have to figure out where it is. But that,
[79:15] that is something that can be, can be fun. Like there's a command palette. Anyway, you can have a look. There's lots and lots of stuff, which might be fun to explore around.
[79:26] This is all so awesome. I'm having so much fun with all the things we can look at. And it also telling us about it from the DevTools itself.
[79:38] Okay, I'm going to end up staring at it and not talk. And I feel like this is, is not what you're supposed to do when you're live streaming.
[79:50] Learner, did you, as I looked up, did you get your answer? Because it's like when you copy and paste it on there, what it will look like. Like if you send it in as a message or something,
[80:06] what it'll look like for the page, I would think like the link to it. So if you, if you put things like your image and your title and whatever, it'll start filling out
[80:16] those previews on the, on the, on the side. I don't believe it's actually Facebook or LinkedIn or Twitter. It's not sending your data away. It's just displaying what it will look like
[80:27] based on the metadata we have. Yeah. Like visuals help me. So in case anybody else needs a visual. It's a good thing I don't have exciting conversations on there, but okay, that one's
[80:46] not it because I, it was, we went live. Where'd the other one go? This one. Okay. I thought it was really funny saying I have a good view on the next week. I, I thought I was hilarious.
[81:00] Doesn't mean I was, but normally it would be that they would be hyperlinked right here, but I saw it on mobile this way. That's weird. Oh, wow. That is a okay. Yay. Okay. Wow. We really
[81:17] did go over a lot today. So metaphor, let's see if I can get it. Metaframeworks next versus next TypeScript, ESLint, CloudFlare and Workers, Edge. Your, how you got into Nuxt and then building
[81:38] Nuxt and the DevTools. And I got really fascinated with the DevTools and I'm like, now I want to go build something with it. Cause that was a lot of fun. Yes. That sounds pretty fun to me. Okay, cool.
[81:54] Yay. Well, this has definitely been, this has been cool. It's been a fun conversation. Nice chat. I forgot one. What? Oranges in the shower. Shower oranges. That was actually the most
[82:07] important. I almost forgot it. If anybody didn't see what that's about when this goes up on YouTube later this week, you can go watch it. It's in like the first 10 minutes and you can watch it.
[82:22] Very excited. Awesome. And Daniel, how do people follow you? Where should they follow you? What's, what's the best contact for like to join the Nuxt community and doing stuff with Nuxt?
[82:37] So you can basically, so you can find me on Twitter. I'm Daniel C. Rowe. So this thing on Twitter. I also have a website, which is probably the best place to go because it has links
[82:52] to everywhere else. But basically feel free to drop me a direct message. The Nuxt discord, you can find me there, message me if you've got any questions or anything. I'm really,
[83:05] really happy to help. I have a little, I put a few thoughts about contributing to Nuxt. If that's not something that you're like, if that's something you want to try, then basically we would be really
[83:20] glad of that as well. So yeah. The main thing is contact me if you've got any questions. I absolutely love it. If someone, if people get in touch, I can help in any way. Yay. Thank you. And thank you
[83:37] everyone for joining today. Lerner, as always, thank you for joining, you specifically, because it's always middle of the night for you. So please go to bed. And looking forward to Christian will
[83:50] be on the show, I think in two weeks. I asked Christian about this and I'm, I'm actually building my website for a calendar that will tell people and consistently scheduled for like two
[84:05] months out. I'm very proud of getting there. So thank you all. And if you want to come hang out with me the next two days, you can build your app as part of the Vueforge community, which uses
[84:19] Nuxt and a lot of it too. I don't know if this one will, I think it does. I should definitely go check it out, but cool. Yay. And let's see who we should raid to. I haven't looked yet.
[84:33] I haven't looked yet. Any requests for the raids? Anyone want to go somewhere specific before I just raid you to whoever I feel like? Well, I know who we're raiding to because nobody
[84:50] asked, but it's definitely Josh. We are raiding to Josh because then we can go talk about more TypeScript. And thank you all. It always takes forever to raid. Daniel, are you good at
[85:03] multitasking during like waiting for the raid to go? I, I'm all about multitasking. Like absolutely. I'm, I feel like I'm always like really bad at doing the raids,
[85:15] but all right, I am hitting end broadcast.
