[00:00] Hello, hello, beautiful humans. Welcome to another episode of Teach Gen Tech. And I'm excited because we are joined today with two humans that I am fortunate enough to call friends,
[00:14] and who are insanely smart and help me level up all the time because they call me out on making me do things better. So, dude, bro, you got one of the cups. I need one of the cups.
[00:29] I've got it. I've got a Jacob mug.
