[00:00] (upbeat music) What up beautiful humans?
[00:05] It is a Friday night and I have a shit ton to do. So I am, yeah, I am here hanging out
[00:17] and I should probably fix my category 'cause it's not in the right category.
[00:24] (upbeat music) Sorry, category, computer, software.
[00:36] (upbeat music) I really not know my category.
[00:55] (upbeat music) What is my normal category?
[01:01] (upbeat music) This is why I live stream though.
[01:09] When I'm by myself I can just listen to this jam the entire time, it's true.
[01:14] (upbeat music) Yeah, you gotta be joking.
[01:23] (upbeat music) Man, I just want to go to the channel.
[01:38] Software and game development, there we go. Software and game development.
[01:48] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[01:53] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[02:24] Yay, I got it set up, dope. I have a giant to-do list to do today
[02:31] and set up my laptop because I had to have it replaced again.
[02:39] So let me find my to-do list. Computer set up, yay.
[02:46] What are y'all doing tonight? Anything fun?
[02:53] 'Cause I'm trying to remember how to use my computer since I haven't used it in forever.
[02:58] I feel like that's always difficult when you're like, uh, I don't remember what I was doing, right?
[03:04] Yeah, I don't know. Let's see.
[03:08] (upbeat music) I don't know.
[03:21] I'm also uploading videos for a Deverell origin story, so we're gonna see how that goes.
[03:27] You know, if my video gets choppy, that's why. 'Cause, you know, I want to do things at the same time,
[03:33] not wait. To-do list, where did my notepad go?
[03:40] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[03:45] I just want to show my old to-do list. It's not, I'm not always the best at to-do list either.
[04:05] So, oh my God. (upbeat music)
[04:15] Like, it just broke them out by category, and now I'm just gonna get really mixed up.
[04:20] So, I mean, basically all of this. Oh, I think I got this done.
[04:29] Maybe. We're gonna say I got it done,
[04:40] 'cause I don't know if I did. (upbeat music)
[04:44] Here we go. So now we don't want it up here.
[05:09] And now I want this. (upbeat music)
[05:15] No. (sighs)
[05:38] (upbeat music) Rude.
[05:46] Rude. It's not what I wanted.
[05:49] Here we go. Maybe.
[05:53] Yes, and y'all can totally make fun of me for like, it's a Friday night, okay?
[05:58] I'm just, it's not, it's not gonna happen. What?
[06:06] (sighs) And you're welcome to say hi and comment along.
[06:21] I'm curious what y'all are up to tonight, 'cause nobody said hi yet.
[06:27] Now will you set up right? (upbeat music)
[06:37] Turn it. (upbeat music)
[06:45] (yells) Oh yeah, we gotta do that too.
[07:10] Ugh. Oh, right.
[07:16] Oh, I can check this. Here is my lovely to-do list.
[07:28] Yay. I have done this one, so that's good.
[07:34] And kind of set up my GitHub.
[07:42] Like, these lovely humans already have theirs like pretty well set up.
[07:47] But, oh. That's fine, confirm.
[07:55] All right, so here's Anthony's account. Like, look, he has like everything so well.
[08:03] Like his outline, what he does, tutorials. I can tell you I am not feeling that dedicated right now.
[08:14] This one is Jay's GitHub.
[08:20] Like, look, look how lovely it looks. It's so fun.
[08:24] There's graphics. And I'm just kinda like, I'm not gonna get there yet, so.
[08:33] But I did, I at least have something on mine because I wasn't able to grab my username for a while.
[08:40] I had it on a, it was stuck with something else. So what's going on here?
[08:47] There we go. No, maybe.
[08:49] My computer doesn't like me. I'm trying to tell it to do too much at once.
[08:55] So weird. What the heck?
[09:03] What is this? There we go.
[09:05] Maybe it'll play nice now. But I do have it set up in the fact
[09:11] that people know a smidge about me of I'm a developed Cata. I have teached in tech.
[09:18] I'm part of the Denver API Meetup, the host of "Shit You Don't Wanna Talk About."
[09:22] Ooh, but that is not in the right place.
[09:28] (upbeat music) So thanks, y'all, showing you.
[09:39] I was able to find it, so that's exciting. And commit changes.
[09:45] There we go. (upbeat music)
[09:55] Oh, I was gonna do that again. Let's see if I can get this to work.
[10:10] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[10:42] No, I'm having to do something offline real quick where you guys can't see, sorry.
[10:47] I have to get this updated for myself so I can re-sign up for Hacktover Fest
[10:53] on the right username. So give me a moment.
[10:58] I guess I could just do it on this. That's fine.
[11:04] (upbeat music) [11:07], yay.
[11:08], yay. (upbeat music)
[11:11] Yay. Which is kinda sad because I did have two out of the four
[11:43] already done for Hacktover Fest, but unfortunately I needed to fix this
[11:56] as soon as possible, especially since job hunting. It's important to make sure that it's under the right name.
[12:09] Yay, safe. All right, so Hacktover Fest is set up, yay.
[12:30] And I believe, let's just do this. (upbeat music)
[12:37] Move these over here. Y'all can see who I'm talking to.
[12:52] Just doesn't mean I want you to see the messages. And wait, let's see.
[13:01] I need to look up the proper gist for this, however you say it, GitHub.
[13:24] I'm pretty sure I have already forked it. (indistinct)
[13:32] Yes, I did, yay. (upbeat music)
[13:51] I hate this. This is gonna be entertaining at least.
[13:59] I feel like for everybody else as I get stuck with stuff. I wonder, I feel like I can do James' video afterwards.
[14:10] We'll get all this stuff done and then do that one, so. (upbeat music)
[14:21] It's giant, yay. So today I am, for all of those
[14:34] that are just starting to join, I am slowly getting started with getting my laptop reset up
[14:40] because Apple had to replace it again. And I need to make sure that I can do this
[14:48] on a regular basis for my live streams. So here we are on a Friday night hanging out
[14:54] 'cause D&D was canceled, at least, yes. Okay, nobody has freaked out that I'm 45 minutes late.
[15:01] I'm good. So I'm going with, I can't copy and paste all this at once.
[15:14] So I'm gonna do line by line, maybe. (upbeat music)
[15:21] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[15:26] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[15:31] (upbeat music) This is gonna take a hot minute, yay.
[16:03] What else do I have on my to-do list? Can I multitask?
[16:06] That's done enough, I can get that one done. Ooh, we can update the website while this is going.
[16:16] Probably not have so many tabs open. I'm just gonna close out of all of them.
[16:25] Yeah, we'll just leave. Oh, no, I wasn't supposed to do that.
[16:31] Oh, well. Y'all, I thought I was done with it.
[16:35] I wasn't, damn it. I'll try uploading that one later.
[16:39] It'll be fine, it'll be fine. I hope.
[16:43] Hmm. (upbeat music)
[16:55] Okay. (upbeat music)
[17:06] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[17:11] All right, y'all. You can totally make fun of my website if you would like
[17:42] because there have been some great improvements. I am very proud of it.
[17:47] This is what it used to look like. Okay, currently looks like.
[17:53] Like this was like my normal background and... Oh, it looks mushy?
[18:01] I did not know that. I wonder if it's because it was trying to upload something.
[18:08] (upbeat music) That's annoying.
[18:10] Thanks for the heads up. Let me see.
[18:14] Oh. Is that any better?
[18:21] 'Cause I was on 480. Oh.
[18:36] Yeah. I'm probably trying to get it to do too much at once.
[18:42] It's my guess. But this is still going.
[18:48] Ooh, that was a little crazy. I'll just leave it there and not touch anything.
[18:55] Or my internet's just trying to tell me that I'm not allowed to do this on a Friday night.
[19:08] I'm also debating if it's that. Like, Jen, you're not allowed to work
[19:12] on a Friday night and stream. Just go do normal things.
[19:17] I think this happened on my last MacBook too where it made it like freeze and be too small and not crisp.
[19:30] (upbeat music) Patiently wait for this thing.
[19:44] Well, anybody have some jokes? Anybody?
[19:54] I can say very awkward ones. So my grandmother-in-law.
[20:01] Yeah. My partner's grandma, grandmother-in-law.
[20:07] She taught me this one. What is the difference between a toad and a horny toad?
[20:14] Anybody know? Any guesses?
[20:26] Receiving, this is going to take forever. Homebrew takes forever.
[20:32] I might just kill this stream. That's sad.
[20:39] I wanted to hang out with people to do this. Coolest stream ever.
[20:49] A whole 20 minutes. All right, y'all.
[20:53] It is just even slowing down for me on other stuff too. I like your new year's resolution.
[21:04] That's pretty funny. Yay.
[21:10] I just want to get a new job. So that way I get a new MacBook to stream and work on.
[21:22] 'Cause I'd have to do this for them too. So I'm like, they'll have to give me something better
[21:26] than the Intel chip. That hates me.
[21:29] I'm going to get a fan though. Hopefully it will help.
[21:34] Anybody have suggestion on fans? And not only ones.
[21:43] I don't know if you guys got that one, but it made me laugh. But like laptop fans, I found a few that I like,
[21:54] but they're all like $20 to $60. And it's like, what's going to be the difference
[22:00] between and $40. (upbeat music)
[22:05] Okay. For anybody that is hanging out and sudo,
[22:28] if you hang out, I'm going to click the run one minute ad break.
[22:32] And I don't know what that experience looks like. And if it actually does anything.
[22:37] So y'all let me know what happens, please. Am I supposed to add one?
[22:53] I don't know. (upbeat music)
[22:59] Oh, it's a pre-uploaded one. They were doing this on coding cat.
[23:22] That's what it is. (upbeat music)
[23:26] I mean, fair enough. But did you actually get an ad or anything?
[23:35] Or is it like, I have to like have a prerecorded thing to tell it to do an ad.
[23:44] I honestly have no idea. Okay, good.
[23:53] At least. You're welcome.
[23:58] You are welcome. Well, that was fun.
[24:05] At least I tried it on this instead of on like my streams when I do them for teach gen tech, like during the day,
[24:11] because when that one has like a bunch of viewers, that would be so bad.
[24:17] (upbeat music) All right, well, I still have to get this stuff done.
[24:26] So, 'cause this is not what the website needs to look like anymore.
[24:32] And I need to update a ton on the calendar. So, I am currently working on my to-do list,
[24:41] which I put somewhere. Which I've been told it may be a bit fuzzy,
[24:49] but I have a new computer. So, I am working on installing all of these scripts
[24:58] and then also setting up my terminal differently and eventually looking at OBS because I use StreamYard
[25:10] and I've heard cooler things. So, I'm just seeing how far I'll get tonight
[25:15] beforehand and how much it drives all of you insane with fuzziness while this is installing.
[25:23] Please tell me you're not uploading. Oh no, did it not upload?
[25:37] Okay, it's still running, good. Oh, org mode, like in stream, like in Twitch or...
[25:49] Where do you put org mode for to-do notes? Oh, org mode that's off.
[25:57] Wow, y'all, it's been, it's Friday night. You can tell it's Friday night, right?
[26:03] Like, brain's not working at the moment. But...
[26:14] Do, let me get a really bad one. Do, I think it's weird when a boyfriend
[26:20] is in passenger seat where his girlfriend drives. I'm giggling because I don't normally drive
[26:32] and when my partner, because my partner always drives and I don't think it's weird,
[26:35] but when Tyler and I first started dating, I got pulled over for reckless driving
[26:46] because I was weaving in and out of traffic. And so, I don't think it's weird.
[26:53] It's like, whoever's comfortable with driving. Anybody else think that's weird?
[26:57] Like, why would it be weird? I hate driving, I don't have a car anymore
[27:03] because I 100% hate driving, but I don't know if anybody else does.
[27:08] (upbeat music) All right, I don't know how fuzzy or not fuzzy
[27:24] this is gonna be for y'all, but I make all of my backgrounds and stuff
[27:29] for the stream now on Canva. And so, this is like the background.
[27:35] This is the background with like the text and everything. But if, like the logo and stuff,
[27:43] like look, ah, see if I can move these for you. The logo used to be like this
[27:50] and this like little, little human-y thing. And it was the favcon and now I don't know
[27:59] what to do with it. I guess I can put a picture of myself here
[28:04] 'cause this is what they look like now. They're actual people.
[28:09] Anybody else has ideas? I am open to ideas.
[28:20] Oh, let's do this. (mumbles)
[28:28] (upbeat music) I think that is a,
[28:37] I don't know what type of size it is, but human.
[28:41] (upbeat music) (humming)
[29:00] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[29:06] That is not exactly the right graphic size, but...
[29:32] (upbeat music) Oh, wait, what?
[29:57] You maxed their features? (upbeat music)
[30:01] It's a mod for organizing tasks, schedule tasks, you can export them to HP.
[30:15] Oh, that's cool. I should look into that.
[30:19] And okay, I need to know, like learn the Twitch commands better.
[30:27] (upbeat music) Or the music one.
[30:33] What does that mean? (laughs)
[30:38] I'm really silly when it comes to the streaming stuff. I need a different graphic size.
[30:47] Oh, that's weird. (upbeat music)
[30:55] (humming) (upbeat music)
[31:10], this is done uploading. [31:15], yay.
[31:16], this is done uploading., yay. (upbeat music)
[31:24] This is done uploading. Yay.
[31:42] (upbeat music) (thuds)
[31:48] Mm-hmm. (upbeat music)
[31:51] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[31:57] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[32:02] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[32:07] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[32:12] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[32:40] Oh, the music is on from StreamYard. It is called, something very exciting,
[32:59] called "Feeding the Ducks". No joke, it's called "Feeding the Ducks".
[33:04] Let's see if I can, we can not freak out too much, but "Feeding the Ducks" is on a loop and it's lovely.
[33:14] I would highly suggest it, but let me see if I can find it for you.
[33:24] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[33:29] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[33:50] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[34:21] There you go, and Nacho also, goodness. Executing code blocks too,
[34:32] so if you're writing a research paper, the other person can recreate your results,
[34:37] but most people use about 10% of the features. The downside is configuration takes some time.
[34:42] Do you have a video or something that you know of that shows more of this?
[34:49] 'Cause I feel like that would be interesting to look into. Nacho.
[34:54] (upbeat music) Are you done?
[35:03] (gasps) You're done.
[35:05] (upbeat music) Run, run.
[35:15] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[35:20] (computer chimes) (upbeat music)
[35:45] (computer chimes) I think I could have done reload.
[35:51] Reload. I don't remember.
[35:57] (upbeat music) (computer chimes)
[36:03] (upbeat music) (computer chimes)
[36:09] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[36:14], you did that. (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[36:22] You did that. (upbeat music)
[36:48] And I'm going to an old video when Anthony and I first set this up
[36:53] to see what I am missing, causing this to be all weird right now.
[36:57] Setting up your computer. 'Cause we never got through it on this one either.
[37:02] (upbeat music) If y'all want to watch something funny,
[37:18] like the first 10 minutes of this stream, we couldn't do anything
[37:23] because I couldn't share my screen. At least I learned the lesson of making sure to do that.
[37:28] (upbeat music) Ooh.
[37:47] Thank you, Nacho. And so everyone else, make sure you see this.
[37:57] Search YouTube for org mode. Tons of people have videos.
[38:00] System Crafters has a Siri on. Oh, that is really cool.
[38:06] Thank you. Let's see.
[38:10] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[38:15] Oh, is that why? (upbeat music)
[38:22] I think it took the rest of the time and that's why, I don't know.
[38:30] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[38:36] Mm-hmm. (upbeat music)
[38:39] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[38:44] Mm. (upbeat music)
[39:13] Oh. (upbeat music)
[39:20] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[39:46] (upbeat music) Mm-hmm.
[39:59] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[40:04] Mm-hmm. (upbeat music)
[40:21] Mm-hmm. (upbeat music)
[40:30] (upbeat music) Oh, did he make this for the M1?
[40:56] (upbeat music) No.
[41:00] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[41:05] the M1. (upbeat music)
[41:09] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)

[54:11] - Here we go. (upbeat music)
[54:23] Yay. (upbeat music)
[54:37] (upbeat music) All right, well, I think I've confused myself enough
[55:03] for the night and have gotten a lot further than I was an hour ago,
[55:08] but I hope all of you beautiful humans have a wonderful evening.
[55:14] And let me know if you have questions to go over later on for Teach Gen Tech.
[55:20] I will be getting to the rest of my to-do list sometime this weekend.
[55:25] Bye y'all. (upbeat music)
