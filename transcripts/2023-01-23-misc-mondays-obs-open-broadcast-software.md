[00:00] - Hello, beautiful humans. Welcome to another episode of Teach Gen Tech
[00:05] with Misk Mondays. Whatever show we're on, whatever we're doing,
[00:10] we're doing Misk Monday today. - Here we are.
[00:13] - This is what we're doing. And with Laura, and we have a guest, Ramon,
[00:17] and I think I'm just rushing through this, A, because it's been like a crazy day,
[00:23] but also I wanna know what the chef is. - Right. (laughs)
[00:28] Hi, everybody. As we were, as you can tell,
[00:31] we started streaming eight minutes after we supposed to, and that was on me because I was just coming out of a call
[00:37] and I really needed to make some tea. And as we were chatting,
[00:43] I mentioned that there's a group of states. If you look from Louisiana up to Minnesota,
[00:49] if you look at the outline, it kind of looks like a chef looking to the right.
[00:53] - I have a link here for Laughing Squid. - In fact, they say that Kentucky
[01:03] kind of looks like he's holding a frying pan. - Oh, I'm gonna zoom out a little bit.
[01:09] - Just to note, this is what has been shared with me. - Here we go.
[01:18] Click on the link, Jen. It's got it colored.
[01:22] - Can you put it in the private chat? - Yeah.
[01:27] Please, please, please is help. 'Cause if it, A, if it just goes to one channel,
[01:34] it doesn't go to all channels. And it also doesn't let you...
[01:39] Oh, that's helpful. That is helpful.
[01:42] That is... - Oh, see, I was looking at it the wrong way around.
[01:47] Kentucky is the chicken. - Which it should be 'cause Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[01:52] - Right. - Oh, okay.
[01:55] Y'all, I'm putting them next to each other. I can see it now.
[01:59] I can see it now. - But so you're telling me you hadn't heard of this before?
[02:03] - No. - No. - I can't where I saw it.
[02:08] - This is the perks of having international friends, y'all. Like, you learn the most random things about the States
[02:17] that I've never heard of. And it's like, it happens all the time.
[02:22] They'll be like, "Hey, did you know this?" And I'm like, "That's a thing."
[02:26] - Oh. - Or U.S. history.
[02:29] I get schooled on U.S. history all the time by people that are not from here.
[02:34] - It's like the list of really weird laws in certain States that are still in effect.
[02:41] One of them's... You know these, right?
[02:43] And I'm not talking about institutionally harmful ones. I'm talking just like literally weird ones.
[02:51] Like, there's one of them where you like, you're not allowed to carry custard in your pockets
[02:57] in some State or something like this. Anyway, sorry to take us on a completely random...
[03:06] I guess this really is miscellaneous Monday. - This is what we do.
[03:11] - A pandemic project of mine was to get really good at, well, to get better at geography.
[03:19] And so doing quizzes so that I could do like, actually put all the names on the States
[03:25] and I could find all the countries. Well, I say all.
[03:31] There are a lot of tiny islands and I don't have all those.
[03:38] I can roughly say like, which ones are from a group of tiny islands
[03:43] in the like neighborhood-ish of like Papua New Guinea. Those sort of islands.
[03:51] And then the islands that are in the neighborhood of say Jamaica,
[03:57] that I can kind of do. Those two, I can be like,
[04:01] okay, I think you belong to this group or that group. But other than that, I mostly, I don't know.
[04:09] I know that like Trinidad and Tobago, those are in the like,
[04:15] I am North of Brazil sort of region, but there's like a curving line of them.
[04:24] And there are like 15 of them. And I can't tell you anymore which one is which.
[04:29] I could for a minute, but I can't. - Fair enough.
[04:32] And I feel like this is like, the perks of Misc Monday is the most random shit we learn.
[04:38] And you are doing a lot better than I am, Laura. Like on that, I was like, I can barely like,
[04:45] like it's, there's stuff out there. I'll go explore it.
[04:49] It'll be fun. - You know, I never really got into Wordle,
[04:55] but I did really get into Worldle. - I haven't heard of Worldle.
[05:01] - So you get a silhouette of a, of a country or a, what is it called?
[05:11] - A state? - Territory? - Territory, I think a territory.
[05:14] I think it's a territory or an entity of a place. Anyway, and you type in, like you type and say,
[05:21] I don't know, type in Austria. And then it's like, well,
[05:23] you're actually 4,000 kilometers South or well, not South, but North of this.
[05:29] - Oh, okay. - And I liked it. That one.
[05:32] - Y'all, I couldn't find where to play Wordle. - I think it's on the New York Times now.
[05:40] - Is it because this is something that I honestly had, I was like, I kept seeing everybody play Wordle
[05:49] and then I'd Google it and it just didn't show up. And I was very annoyed and I'm just pasting,
[05:59] oh, that's not where I meant to paste it. I'm pasting them all in the chat so they go to all of us.
[06:08] Oh, wait, no, I almost did the same one again. All right, so I know we're,
[06:13] just so that way people know why we're here, as well as our random handouts and starting rates,
[06:21] I'm Jen and if you're watching on my show, I'm Teach Gen Tech.
[06:26] And yesterday we hit past 200 followers. Very excited about this.
[06:32] - Congratulations. - Hey, I'm Teach Gen Tech. - Yeah, yeah. - Fabulous.
[06:36] - So pretty excited about that and also we, Laura, the way this show started is Laura came on,
[06:47] well, Ramon came on Teach Gen Tech and we learned about an API.
[06:52] That's about all I remember. And we became friends and then he was like,
[06:57] Laura, it should be on your show. It was cool and Laura and I just hit it off
[07:02] and realized we're not great at just talking about Python. So we started MISC Monday.
[07:09] We just talked about some random shit to get our week started and it makes my week so lovely
[07:14] because then I get all the shenanigans of how much I dread the week out
[07:19] because I look forward to talking to Laura. And Ramon's here to talk to us about OBS
[07:26] because it is a pretty well, pretty big tool that makes streaming more leveled up.
[07:35] And it's something that Laura and I both wanna learn about. So Ramon is our first guest on MISC Mondays and-
[07:44] - Second appearance of our first guests. - First guest, second appearance.
[07:51] - Very true, very true. And yeah, I just wanna make sure we have that announced
[07:56] so anybody that has joined us so far knows what we're doing today.
[08:01] - Well, thank you both so much for having me here. If you're watching on my stream,
[08:09] I'm joining Jen and Laura's MISC Mondays and we are cross collabing here.
[08:14] So it's really cool. Last week I came on and (speaking in foreign language)
[08:22] Hi to Ramon and people I don't know. Do you wanna both tell us a little bit about yourselves?
[08:30] - I wanna give you the opportunity to. - Laura, you can go first.
[08:36] - Okay. Hi, I'm Laura.
[08:38] I am, oh, I was going to like a launch into what has become like my traditional spiel
[08:44] but my job title just changed. I am no longer a technical writer at Suborbital Systems.
[08:49] I am now a developer advocate at Suborbital Systems. I was going to say it last week and I totally forgot
[08:55] 'cause I don't think we did the like intro spiels. - Oh, I sometimes forget.
[09:00] - And I was a math professor until just over a year ago. And I also work with Ramon at Suborbital Software Systems.
[09:11] - I do things. - So many things.
[09:19] - Hold on, I gotta write this down. - Oh my God.
[09:27] - Oh, what do I do? I am a podcast host when I put out more episodes
[09:33] of shit you don't wanna talk about. And I love talking about shitty topics.
[09:38] Yes, I will talk about poop, but I also talk about and have conversations
[09:45] about racial biases, homelessness, which should be called houselessness
[09:53] because it's not necessarily that they don't have a home. And also just a lot of really difficult topics.
[10:00] Like we've talked about death on the podcast. And then I also am newer into tech.
[10:07] So I started this live stream called Teach Gen Tech and I've been learning how to code
[10:13] and currently working on my website, which has become quite disastrous and super fun.
[10:20] And I am also a developer advocate looking for work. So please hire me.
[10:27] And I'm an MC doing View Nation this week. - Ooh, we got a link for that?
[10:34] - We do, we do. I will link it here shortly.
[10:37] And I host a Twitter space every Wednesday called, except this Wednesday 'cause I'm MC,
[10:43] called Mental Health and Neurodiversity in Tech. I think that is all I do.
[10:56] Ooh, Jay, yes. I need to reply to PJ actually.
[10:59] I might have some freelance work to do with PJ and I needed to work on an article
[11:09] and I forgot to email him back. So I'm gonna put that on my to-do list of email PJ.
[11:15] - Awesome. - Jen, you mentioned the Neurodiversity Twitter spaces
[11:23] that you do. And that reminded me that I have not taken my meds today.
[11:28] And so I'm gonna be right back. - Do it.
[11:30] - Continuing my episode. - Yes, that being said,
[11:34] that is something that I really like about the people that come on the stream
[11:39] and the conversations we started having is we show up as we are.
[11:44] Like we were all late. Okay, Laura's on time.
[11:47] Laura's almost always on time. Like Laura is normally like the most punctual person I know.
[11:54] And then there's me who, especially with people I stream with regularly,
[11:59] even people that, okay, I shouldn't say that. I'm just really bad at being on time for streaming.
[12:04] And so it was basically, I was running late. Ramon was running late, but it was mostly me
[12:13] because I even forgot to double check with Ramon. And we also, I forget to tell people
[12:18] that they're coming on the show. I make plans for people in my head
[12:21] and then don't tell them about it. My friend, Denae, I've done this to her so many times
[12:27] that I'm like, "Hey, we're hanging out Sunday, right?" And she's like, "We are?"
[12:32] - I feel you. - Yes, we are. If she's free, because I forgot to tell her.
[12:39] And that is something I think is so beautiful about embracing neurodiversity is,
[12:45] and for those who may be new to the term, I'm gonna go with my own terminology for it.
[12:52] Neurodiversity or neurodivergent is something that can be summed up
[12:59] as just not being atypical, but is mostly in what I think more of it
[13:05] is when you may have different mental health things. I don't wanna say challenges.
[13:19] I like things such as, it can be autism, ADHD. Those are something I think a lot of people think about
[13:27] when they hear neurodivergent or neurodivergency. What I consider it as is anything from depression,
[13:38] anxiety, PTSD, bipolar. Okay, I'm just naming all the ones that I have
[13:45] I can think of, but it's this very big umbrella of just not saying that we all have to be exactly the same.
[13:53] We all have our different quirks and learning to embrace them
[14:00] instead of shutting them down. And Bakari just said, "Brain works and processes
[14:08] in a way that is considered typical." Yes, anything that's not that.
[14:13] So I love hanging out with this crew, it's fun. And Ramon for Laura's in my stream,
[14:25] would you like to introduce yourself, please? - Cool, all right, I'll give it a try.
[14:32] My name's Ramon, I am a developer advocate part-time at Suborbital Software Systems with Laura
[14:39] where I mostly do web assembly and extensibility advocacy.
[14:48] In my spare time, I also consult as a developer advocate. I do a little bit of, I do a lot of developer education
[14:58] and essentially spend a lot of my time trying to enable others to succeed in tech.
[15:08] It's something that I- - Like both of us, in fact.
[15:12] - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's true. It's true.
[15:17] - Right, that is what we're doing today, right? Pardon me? - Yeah.
[15:21] - Ramon is the reason I started my stream. - Well, that's very kind.
[15:25] I mean, all I said was, all I did was be like, "Hey, you should stream."
[15:28] And then you went with it. - Yeah.
[15:33] - So that's on you. (both laughing)
[15:38] - Yes, sorry, y'all. I'm trying to get all of our links
[15:42] and when it goes to our pages, it will auto play.
[15:51] Is Suborbital hiring? - Good, I was just gonna find a break to bring that up.
[15:57] We are not hiring at the moment. We are an early stage startup.
[16:00] Watch the space. Sorry, that's all I can say.
[16:04] - Unless I missed something, Laura. I don't think I did.
[16:06] - We're not unhiring, which has been a really big theme recently.
[16:15] - Yes. - Oh, you were knocking on wood
[16:20] and I'm like, "Who's there?" - Sorry, sorry.
[16:24] To everybody with good microphones, I'm sorry. (both laughing)
[16:31] - Throw me off, man. - I think Ramon also told me
[16:34] to start programming streams and I haven't. Like, look, you don't have to.
[16:38] You can. It's good fun.
[16:40] I find it a good way to be able to learn in public and get better at understanding certain concepts.
[16:45] Getting stuck and showing your problem-solving process is something that I find really valuable.
[16:52] - And really quick, last but not least, before we get started.
[16:59] Damn it, y'all. I put it in the private chat.
[17:03] Hold on, there we go. They got posted.
[17:07] That is all of our channels. If you could go follow all of us
[17:12] or share our stuff and things, 'cause we're cool.
[17:17] And do it. - Noelle is here.
[17:20] Talking through pinched coins is super helpful. Good to see you, Noelle with one L.
[17:24] Hope you're doing one good. - I feel like I haven't seen Noelle in forever.
[17:30] - I'm not sure that I've met Noelle before. - My favorite people in tech.
[17:37] - Noelles don't. - Nice.
[17:41] Anyway, I'm just gonna hijack the conversation back to the topic of neurodiversity for a second,
[17:50] 'cause I am coining a new term. - What's that?
[17:53] Let me see. - I accidentally, so I dropped a link in the private chat.
[17:58] I can, I'm not sure where I should put it instead, but I accidentally saw,
[18:07] I misread the word neurodiverse as neuroverse, like universe, but for neuro,
[18:14] and I just loved it. And so I am coining that term.
[18:18] We are all members, literally all, like including people who we also refer to as neurotypical.
[18:25] I don't think that there is, like that would sort of imply a statistical center
[18:32] that I don't think exists. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18:36] And so I think that this is more inclusive of literally everyone.
[18:40] We are all members of the neuroverse. And you know the little like,
[18:44] you are here posters that they make of our universe, well, like a bit of our universe,
[18:51] and it'll say like, you are here, whatever. And so like, there'll be,
[18:55] and it's a multidimensional space, right? Like we're not talking about like a spectrum
[18:59] 'cause that's a two-dimensional space, and that doesn't make any sense for brains.
[19:03] I think brains are actually more than three dimensions as well,
[19:06] but anyway, at least three, definitely not two. And so everybody has their own little spot
[19:12] in the neuroverse. - I dig it.
[19:15] - Yeah. - I dig it.
[19:17] - That's fantastic. - And thank you, Laura, for sharing,
[19:20] 'cause that is a, it's in all of the chats now,
[19:25] in case anybody missed it, but definitely also go follow Laura on Hackiderm.
[19:32] - Mastodon, and Hackiderm is the server that I'm on on Mastodon.
[19:39] - Did I talk to you in the right platform this time? - Oh, well, do you mean like in the last three seconds?
[19:45] 'Cause I haven't checked that, but. - No, like the one I sent you earlier.
[19:49] - Yeah. - Okay, that's good.
[19:51] 'Cause at Rambly Chat, there's, y'all have like a million accounts.
[19:55] - Who's y'all here? - You two, you both have multiple Mastodon accounts.
[20:01] So I'm like, I don't know who to tag. - Someone, somebody, well, several somebodies actually
[20:06] on Mastodon have made like aggregators, I guess, that somehow like make accounts.
[20:13] Like there's one that's like bird, bird site or something like that.
[20:18] And like, there are a whole bunch of different ones. And so it'll be like pulling people in from Twitter.
[20:25] But they're not those people's actual accounts. - It's frustrating.
[20:30] - It's a little confusing. - It's not my favorite.
[20:36] - Mastodon is confusing in general. - I've gotten used to it, but we're gonna end up
[20:42] going down another tangent. So I'm gonna pause us.
[20:45] Let's pause and go into OBS. Go Ramon.
[20:49] - Look what I've assertively done. - Good job.
[20:53] - Do we, 'cause last week I joined the stream. I had a really good time explaining to you
[21:02] a little bit of the basics of Mastodon. Do we wanna, oh, sorry, not Mastodon, OBS.
[21:08] Yeah, I can't even. - The thing we're doing today.
[21:11] Yeah, whatever it's called. I like it, whatever.
[21:13] - Do we wanna recap a little? - Yeah, yeah.
[21:16] - Yeah, cool. Then in that case, I'm gonna need a browser window.
[21:19] So excuse me, wait, I could have stuck there. Hold up folks.
[21:23] Hold up folks, hold up, hold up, hold up. Gonna bring that back.
[21:27] And I'm gonna open a new Chrome window and look at the patterns.
[21:31] - While you're doing that, Noelle said, "My biggest barrier to joining Mastodon
[21:38] "is that you don't quite understand which server to join." Fair, fair, because I joined a server
[21:45] and then it shut down or never loaded. It was a nightmare.
[21:49] And Dervon, is that how I say it? - Dervon.
[21:55] - Dervon. Read somewhere that the person who created
[22:00] the script service open sourced it. And now there are multiple Twitter Mastodon things.
[22:06] Although they don't want to use it anymore. Interesting, interesting.
[22:13] All right, well. - Cool.
[22:16] So I'm gonna do a crash course based on what we did last week.
[22:20] Oh, sorry, I got distracted. It's all bit said really wonderfully.
[22:26] The term neuroverse sounds more inclusive and descriptive than the linear spectrum.
[22:30] And I dig it. - That's what I felt like.
[22:33] - Yeah. Cool.
[22:36] This time we got it. OBS, open broadcaster software.
[22:41] It is a piece of software that, an open source piece of software that we use
[22:45] to be able to both stream to different channels, like YouTube, Twitch, LinkedIn Live,
[22:52] Twitter, whatever it's called. And of course, Twitch, yeah.
[22:57] And that is open source that runs on our computer. Folks, if you're wondering what we're doing right now
[23:03] to stream, we're streaming from the browser in a web app called StreamYard.
[23:08] Differences between the two can vary. StreamYard is not free.
[23:12] OBS is free because it's open source. StreamYard uses resources from the cloud.
[23:18] OBS uses resources from your computer. So if you want to be a little bit mindful
[23:21] of your computer resources, you want to stick to StreamYard, for example.
[23:25] Stream, sorry, StreamYard is very fixed in things like what we can do with like layout, right?
[23:34] For example, I can drag and drop and rearrange Laura and Jen and myself.
[23:38] We can do all this good stuff, but it's fixed to this, on this axis.
[23:44] We also have a little bit of like rearranging we can do. For example, we can do this.
[23:49] We can make my screen sharing full screen. We can do this, which can be a little bit alarming.
[23:56] At first, we can have just Jen. We can have the three of us.
[24:00] So like, in terms of streaming lingo, we would call this perhaps scenes or layouts, right?
[24:07] - How do you rearrange us though? - Drag and drop.
[24:10] - Oh, it dies. - Yeah, yeah.
[24:15] So this is a little bit off topic from what is possible with accidental face zoom.
[24:21] Yeah, it's like when you open your phone camera and you like accidentally have it
[24:24] on like the front facing camera and you're like, you know, it's like early in the morning.
[24:31] Yeah, anyway, sorry, completely off topic. Right, so this is very fixed.
[24:42] OBS gives us a lot more flexibility. So that's what I want to demonstrate to you today.
[24:46] So I'm just going to bring my screen back. In case you're wondering how I'm doing this,
[24:50] Laura, Jen and I on StreamYard have these admin powers that let us do it.
[24:55] Here's the other thing though. StreamYard gives you that very easy,
[24:58] like bring on a guest and chat with them functionality. That's not as easy with StreamYard on OBS.
[25:05] More on that later. So what you are seeing now
[25:09] is my OBS setup. I was actually just recording a video.
[25:16] So yes, StreamYard, oh, sorry, I need to get this out of my head.
[25:20] OBS also lets you record video, which is something that I do quite often.
[25:24] I was doing a little like, hey, come join us next week at JSConf Chile
[25:28] 'cause I'm speaking there. I'm actually going to Chile for the first time since 2007,
[25:32] completely off topic. I'm very excited.
[25:34] - Yay. - Link, link, link. Ah, yes, let's get that up in just a second.
[25:41] Sorry, folks. I'm going to have a bit of a mess going on here.
[25:43] I might have to, ah, fantastic. So what you see here at the bottom left,
[25:50] oh, good, you can see my mouse cursor. At the bottom left here, you've got my scenes, remember?
[25:55] I was talking about these before and these are customized. So you can see they're not perfectly aligned.
[25:59] That's because the perfect is the enemy of the good. That's my workflow.
[26:06] (laughs) But what does it let me have?
[26:09] It lets me have my webcam, which you see there. Fantastic.
[26:12] You can see that I can have the chat here. I use an app called Chatterino.
[26:16] That's with two Ts, which Jen or Laura, I hope you don't mind, please, linking for me.
[26:22] (laughs) Chatterino for displaying your chat on your server.
[26:28] Now you can see this is my Twitch chat, which you see, nobody's really talking right now,
[26:33] which is very like, it's not an obligation. You don't have to chat if you don't want to.
[26:36] Why do I have my chat on my stream? Here's the thing.
[26:40] When you're streaming to say Twitch, Jen just popped in to say hi, you can see it showed up.
[26:46] Thank you, Jen. Noelle saying chat.
[26:49] Now here's the thing. If there is a 30-ish second delay between Twitch and,
[26:54] no, me, what I say, and the chat coming through. So what does that mean?
[27:00] If I have the chat on my stream, then y'all can see what I see,
[27:05] which is something I find helpful. I also like having there for say recordings of my stream.
[27:14] If I want to keep a recording of the chat as well, well, lo and behold, there it is.
[27:19] Now this design that you see on the top, this is just a design that I brought in from Canva.
[27:25] It's an image, it's a still image that I keep there that just has my, I haven't streamed in a while,
[27:29] so I don't know if I'd want to keep my Twitter handle there, but you get my point.
[27:33] And Diophandin, see, you can see, I can see what Diophandin Beagn said.
[27:38] Yeah, off topic, if you're interested in the Twitter bots on Mastodon,
[27:44] because of course, one thing that StreamYard does that is quite nice.
[27:47] It lets you click on comments and highlight them. Of course, that's not possible
[27:52] from a fresh installation of OBS. So back to OBS.
[27:57] I'm so sorry, I'm all over the place. Let's talk about this big blank space you see here.
[28:05] Usually, what I would have here is my browser. Of course, I've closed the browser window,
[28:10] so I kind of need to like mess around with it to get it back.
[28:14] Let me see real quick. So you can see I've got way too many,
[28:18] way too many windows open on my computer, but I can pick one here.
[28:22] And now you're going to see, I need to rearrange that a little bit.
[28:25] So there you can see my OBS, and this is kind of how I would do it
[28:30] usually when I'm streaming. How are we doing so far?
[28:34] - Really quick. I'm just happy that we have links
[28:42] to the Twitter bots on Mastodon. I will link those to the rest of the streams.
[28:51] And also we have the Chattarino, and also I personally like ShowMyDotChat
[29:01] because it's Ben Myers. And it is pretty cool.
[29:08] And I say this because I've gotten some OBS stuff, just not much, but I got this far,
[29:15] and then I kind of got frustrated. So yes, please continue.
[29:20] - Yeah, yeah. So as you can see, a lot of this is pretty ad hoc,
[29:23] and like, hold on, I got to read. I'm literally resizing my Chrome window
[29:27] so that it goes all the way to the bottom. So none of this is pixel perfect.
[29:30] Again, enemy, perfect, good, all that. So this is one scene.
[29:36] And you can see here, if I go over from the scenes to the list of sources,
[29:43] all of these are different things that I put onto my scene. And these can be a window capture,
[29:48] which you see highlighted here. An audio output capture.
[29:53] Audio, for example, when I'm playing music that I want to play on my stream,
[29:57] goes through OBS back into the stream. Does that make sense?
[30:01] Yeah, so that's streaming my audio output. I've got a piece of text here called OC,
[30:10] more on that in a minute. Let's see what else we got.
[30:13] Color source, I've got like a little purple background. We've got the chat window.
[30:18] We've got video capture device. That's me, hello.
[30:22] We've got audio input capture. You see, it's capturing my microphone.
[30:26] You can select which microphone you want to stream from. You can put in several microphones if you're feeling fancy.
[30:31] You can put in several webcams if you're feeling fancy. Let's see what else we got.
[30:38] And my background image, of course. And you can see as I talk here in the audio mixer,
[30:42] you can see, yeah, it's doing the little audio mixy thing. And if I were to play some audio and stream it through,
[30:48] it would do that as well. So let's talk about OC for a second.
[30:52] That's short for open captions. This is a third-party plugin that I installed
[30:59] onto StreamYard. Oh, I can do this here through OBS.
[31:03] OBS Closed Captioning Plugin. LittleBips is repeating myself from last week,
[31:11] so I apologize if you've already seen this, but I think it's good to be--
[31:15] - I have the link from last week. - Oh, you do?
[31:18] - Yeah. - Ah, wonderful.
[31:21] Thank you. So yes, I highly recommend this.
[31:25] So how does this work? You can set it up to accept a source of audio.
[31:32] This can be all audio. It can be just your audio.
[31:35] Now, I'm not going to start streaming 'cause I'm already streaming from StreamYard,
[31:39] but I'm going to start a voice recording. You're going to see what's going to happen.
[31:42] Hello, I am recording a video and it's recording captions for me.
[31:51] It's not perfect. We saw last week that when I tried speaking Spanish,
[31:55] it kind of gave up. You can pick a language in the options though,
[32:01] which is cool. And this works with Google Speech-to-Text.
[32:07] So it turns your speech into text. So I'm going to stop that.
[32:13] This is also sending closed captions. What you saw here were open captions,
[32:20] meaning that they're embedded into the video. But of course, you also have the possibility
[32:23] of doing closed captions that are built into Twitch. So you have both options, which I think is nice.
[32:29] Bakari Sol's got a question. Do you think there's a clear advantage
[32:33] in using OBS or StreamYard for streaming live music? So this is music that you're performing, I assume,
[32:37] or is it like, you'll have to forgive me, I'm not very knowledgeable.
[32:40] Are you like- - In Bakari's case, I would assume so.
[32:43] - Yeah, I think it's him streaming because he also sings and does duets.
[32:49] Let's see if I can talk on TikTok. Wow, words, it's really cool.
[32:55] You also follow Bakari on the TikToks, on the TikToks. - Yeah, send us your TikTok if you want to get followed.
[33:02] Like, no stress if you don't want to. So, well, the reason I ask, define that,
[33:07] because for example, if you want to do sophisticated things like having one window per, for example,
[33:13] yeah, yeah, yeah, like this, right? Live looping and all that.
[33:18] If you want to have all that, you can have like one window per,
[33:23] like one window capture per, I don't know, for like Logic Pro,
[33:27] I don't know what folks are using nowadays, or for your, what's the one that's based in Germany?
[33:32] I really like them. Ableton, for your Ableton stuff.
[33:36] So you can have like one per music software plugin as well. Yeah.
[33:45] - That's a good question. - Exactly, so like you can do that.
[33:49] Galbrush, I'll get to you in just a sec, get back to you in just a sec about the transcript
[33:54] because that is a good question. But yeah, so if you want to have that power to customize,
[33:59] for example, if you've got two microphones, I don't know, like one for your guitar
[34:03] and like on the other side of the room for a singer or something,
[34:06] then you can use OBS to put like two microphones and stream those.
[34:10] The problem is it's more taxing on your computer. There's Bakari's TikTok, wonderful.
[34:15] Okay, I hope that's helpful, Bakari. Let's talk about transcripts.
[34:20] Yeah, because that's a good question. Let's go over to, here we go.
[34:25] I'm going to open up the settings for my captioning. I'm sorry, it's as big as it's going to get.
[34:34] I can't control the size. - I think you can if you increase your,
[34:41] or decrease rather, your resolution. - Right, that's going to be out or something.
[34:47] Like, that's a good point, Laura, and I'll keep that for the next time.
[34:51] But, Galbrush, if you go over to transcripts and then click enable this,
[34:58] oh, actually I can make it slightly bigger by doing this. It's not a huge difference, but it's something.
[35:03] - Yay! - If you click on save transcripts
[35:07] and then you can choose what folder it goes into, you get SRT files,
[35:11] which are very common subtitle files formats, or you can have a custom one, up to you.
[35:17] But yeah, so you can totally save transcripts, which is helpful to have.
[35:23] I'm a big fan of accessibility, so being able to have captions,
[35:26] which is sadly something that StreamYard does not offer. And I've bugged them a couple times about it,
[35:33] and they have other priorities, which is fine. That's their deal.
[35:38] Jeff van den Bergen asks, "Which formats are available?" So for captions, I saw only SRT,
[35:43] but if you're talking about recording video, I just opened up the OBS settings.
[35:52] Here you can customize what formats, for example. So recording format MKB,
[36:01] you can set this to whatever the heck you like. MP4 is probably gonna be nicer for me.
[36:09] So I'll just, ah, right. Jeff van den Bergen says, "No, closed captioning formats
[36:15] above the name input." So that would be, ah, ah, thank you, yes.
[36:22] So we have SRT, TXT, or just raw, raw text. It's a good question, thank you.
[36:31] - Really quick, y'all, I don't think it's gonna break anything,
[36:34] but I am gonna open StreamYard in another tab. So if this crashes, we will all be back very, very shortly.
[36:42] I just don't think it will. So please continue, Ramon.
[36:44] Just wanted to give everybody a heads up. - Great point, Jen, by the way,
[36:48] talking to the difference between StreamYard and OBS. Because the stream is running by itself,
[36:52] the worst thing that's gonna happen if something were to mess up
[36:56] with Jen opening a second tab is that Jen will just be there twice.
[37:00] So it might turn into a little bit of an echo, like a literal echo chamber.
[37:06] So that shouldn't be a problem. However, if things mess up with OBS,
[37:11] it's running on your computer. Say your computer runs out of power.
[37:15] You can't switch over to your phone and be like, "I'm still here, folks."
[37:18] Like, stream is still running, you know what I mean? So that's something to watch out for for using OBS.
[37:23] How are we doing so far, any questions? - No.
[37:29] - Wonderful. Laura?
[37:35] - Nope. - Oh, sorry, I thought I heard you, like...
[37:38] - I was about to read a question that had already been answered.
[37:42] - Okay, yes, I do have a question. It was a JK that I didn't have a question.
[37:46] I actually have a question. Are there, and this is probably,
[37:51] let me go to another tab and see if I can, like, blow this up so I can, like, see more.
[38:00] Is, can you have different profiles? So if you set up a bunch of scenes, it's like for,
[38:08] like, if I had one for Teach Gen Tech, and then I had one for, I don't know,
[38:13] shit you don't wanna talk about, and then I had one for when I convinced Jay and Laura
[38:20] and everyone in the world to be on a show together. Like, it's gonna be the busiest show ever.
[38:29] - I would've tuned into that. - Yeah, so, like, how would you keep those straight,
[38:33] and could you talk us through, like, or, like, maybe Laura or I could stream, like,
[38:39] how you actually go to set one of these up? 'Cause I think that's-
[38:43] - That's something we didn't get to last week, and I- - Yeah, that's where
[38:45] I'm really stuck. - Cool, let's answer the first question.
[38:49] If you see here at the top, at the top of the menus, you have a menu option called Scene Collection.
[38:58] So here you can manage different scene collections. - Okay.
[39:04] - So you can create a new one. If you are a complete disorganized mess like me,
[39:10] you will not. But to those of you who value not living in chaos,
[39:16] create and manage your own, yeah. So you can create a new one, give it a name,
[39:22] and then, like, copy them over and all that. Do bear in mind that all of the assets
[39:26] and the scenes themselves are locked into your computer. You can export them,
[39:30] but they're very tied to where the images are, for example, are located.
[39:34] So they're not as portable as one would like them to be. Does that make sense?
[39:38] - Yes. - I'm gonna quickly close the door.
[39:42] I'll be right, right back. - And I am going to be opening OBS
[39:52] and, like, deleting everything I have. (Jen laughs)
[39:56] 'Cause I wanna try to set this up at the same time. - Awesome.
[40:01] Let's, to your point, Jen, let's explore what kind of possibilities
[40:07] there are for scenes in OBS. Because let me,
[40:11] and I'm just gonna show you a couple more of mine, and then we'll, like, go into making one
[40:14] if that sounds good. - Yes, sorry.
[40:18] Very distracted. - You're good.
[40:20] So let's-- - Because I think, like, another thing that just came to mind
[40:25] is the fact that, like, Laura's and my background is completely different than,
[40:32] oh, by the way, I should probably update that, is normally--
[40:36] - Update what? I guess we'll find out in just a moment, folks.
[40:42] Laura's-- - Yep. - Sorry, Jen just left the chat.
[40:44] (Jen laughs) We're back.
[40:47] They will need to connect their mic/cam before you can add them to the stream.
[40:50] Hold on, like, give us a sec, folks. We're coming in.
[40:53] (laughs) Mistakes were made.
[40:54] - Yep, well-- (Jen laughs)
[40:58] Do you know what? I'm not gonna click her in.
[41:00] (Jen laughs) I'm not gonna click her in.
[41:01] - I figured out what happened. I did this last week, too, and I didn't know what it was.
[41:06] - What was it? - So Mac has it where, randomly, if you go left to right,
[41:12] it will go back on a browser. - Yeah, yeah, exactly so. - It was very annoying.
[41:21] So I'm gonna disable that really quick. - Okay.
[41:24] - Do you wanna-- - But I'm gonna update the background,
[41:29] and then I'm gonna do that. - Oh, our back, oh, that's what you mean.
[41:35] Okay, gotcha, gotcha. Yeah, and I did a little bit of the,
[41:39] shall we do the-- - Yeah, do the things, do the things.
[41:43] - Let's do the things. - Sorry for the Jen interruption.
[41:45] It's kind of what happens. - You're fine. That is not an inter, this is Miscellaneous Mondays, Jen,
[41:49] lest we forget. - It's not mine. - So I'm gonna show you a couple more scenes of mine.
[41:54] This, for example, is what I call the code scene. I don't have VS Code running right now,
[42:01] but I'd normally have a big VS Code running here, and then if I wanna type a little bit on a website,
[42:07] and then I wanna go back to the website, I'll just click between browser and code.
[42:10] You can see most of the layout stays the same, but it's fading in and out.
[42:17] In fact, you can choose transitions here in the middle. I'm actually, I'm not very experimenting with these.
[42:25] What is a luma wipe? Let's find out.
[42:28] Ooh, ooh, okay. Kind of giving me a "Star Wars" vibe.
[42:33] But yeah, so you can, I don't know what a stinger is. Sorry, I'm just messing around with these.
[42:41] Ooh, look at, ooh, I kind of dig this one. You see how it's like, whew.
[42:49] Ooh. Yeah, so you can switch between them.
[42:53] For example, I've got this one here, which I use to like, I'm usually debugging games that I make
[42:58] on a little game console. I've got just a chatting one, just to be like,
[43:03] "Hi, it's me, good to see you." And here's a tip for folks streaming to Twitch.
[43:08] Give your streamer, like when you're streaming, it sends out a notification to all of your followers.
[43:16] Give them five minutes or so to get all their notifications and get excited about the fact that you're gonna be on.
[43:22] Have a starting soon scene. I made this in Canva.
[43:26] I made this with one of those like AI, make a picture of, turn me into a cartoon character
[43:31] kind of things. Ooh, Makari Soul is asking,
[43:37] "How do folks stream console gaming on Twitch?" Let me get back to that question in just a second,
[43:41] 'cause it is a good question. Yeah, we got a starting soon.
[43:46] We got a see you next time. So like, and you can see there's no audio here
[43:51] because of course, I don't know if you're familiar with the term hot mic.
[43:54] Which is when you go off the, yeah. - Yeah.
[43:59] No, explain it, sorry. - No, you're good.
[44:01] It's like kind of like when you go off the air and people can still hear you and you might.
[44:06] - It's awkward. - It's awkward, yes.
[44:08] I was just gonna say, like, I usually let out a giant sigh after I'm done streaming.
[44:12] So like, it's really embarrassing to be like, "See you next time," and then go, "Ahh," you know?
[44:18] - Yeah, but the Excel is so important because if anybody is like,
[44:24] hasn't emceed or done a talk or streamed or podcasting, like you have to have like this energy to present.
[44:35] And then it's like, "Okay, I can deflate now." - Totally.
[44:41] So let's see what else we got. - This is actually kind of comfortable.
[44:43] Do you think people would still watch my streams if I just streamed like this?
[44:48] - I mean, you'd have to move your camera a little bit, but I think you'd be good.
[44:51] - Joe Biden. Oh, did Biden have a hot mic problem?
[44:59] Oh, familiar. - That's a question for the American citizens and residents.
[45:10] Joe Biden said big blank deal when on a hot mic. - Oh, was he right though?
[45:19] - I mean. - I hope so, but I don't know the context.
[45:24] So we're going to go, yeah, maybe? - Yeah, okay.
[45:27] Bakaria tells us he was right. - And Sue says right correctly.
[45:31] I think all politicians have had hot mic issues at some point in their career.
[45:35] - Yes. Yes.
[45:37] Anywho, yeah. For example, I use this one to make a video,
[45:41] which is all well and good. So let's go about making a scene together, if I may.
[45:52] Not causing a scene, making a scene. I'm kidding.
[45:58] So I'm just going to delete this random scene I have. That is my computer with all of its mess out.
[46:05] How very embarrassing. (laughs)
[46:09] Let me bring back a random one. Here we go.
[46:12] Okay, cool. Shall we make a new scene together?
[46:16] - Oh, really quick. Yeah, take out the at.
[46:24] I'm sorry, it's all bits. Take out the at.
[46:27] I'm used to Twitters. - An at from?
[46:34] Oh, gotcha. - Yeah.
[46:38] It's what Ryan just put here. And hi, Ryan.
[46:43] - Hey, Ryan. - Hey, Ryan.
[46:45] - Oh, shit. I was supposed to talk to Ryan about something.
[46:47] What was I going to talk to Ryan about? Oh, Ryan.
[46:54] Before I forget, Ryan's a mod on my channel and also just like knows the things
[46:59] and stuff with stream elements. But Theo has it where he can time mark things.
[47:06] I don't know, it's something in stream elements where like he'll,
[47:10] so Theo will actually make it where he records his video content while he's live streaming.
[47:18] So instead of just like doing live streaming where you can tell this is very interactive,
[47:22] it would just be like doing it straight to the camera, no interruptions or anything and recording it that way.
[47:31] It's really cool. And I will grab stream elements as well
[47:34] because I did not know what they were. And stream elements may also help set up OBS,
[47:42] but don't quote me on that. They can do some templates,
[47:49] but I use it for something else. - Cool.
[47:53] And yeah, I'm not very familiar with stream elements myself, but go check it out.
[48:01] So shall we make, Jen, I've been screen sharing for a while.
[48:08] Do you want to do it on your end? - Sure.
[48:11] - I had the, 'cause I kind of get the impression that it would make more sense if one of y'all did it
[48:15] and then I could just sort of like nod along. - Yes, but I do want to give Laura the option
[48:20] before I just say yes and like. - Oh yeah, sorry.
[48:24] - Oh, go ahead. - Okay.
[48:26] I was like, yes, I do. I totally do, a hundred percent.
[48:28] Like I would love to, because I want to get this set up, but I also just don't want to hog the entire thing
[48:34] 'cause it's definitely something I've done before. Okay.
[48:40] So here is my stream elements, which is very difficult. - Now this looks different from mine.
[48:48] What do we look? Why does the UI look a little bit different, Jen?
[48:52] Could it be a newer version of OBS? You said something about stream elements.
[48:57] - This is just StreamYard or stream. This is just OBS, sorry.
[49:03] - Okay. - That looks the same as mine.
[49:06] - Maybe mine is old. Anyway, carry on.
[49:10] - But on that note, I feel like I don't care if I mess up my displays
[49:18] because I mess up a lot of my computer anyway. In case y'all wanted to know,
[49:22] I'm really good at breaking stuff. And this happens quite a bit.
[49:26] Where are my displays? - What are you doing?
[49:31] - Going to up the- - Oh, the resolution.
[49:37] - I was gonna up the resolution. - You know, I tried last week to make an Alfred workflow
[49:44] to do this for me and I did not succeed. I was actually going to ask Jay
[49:52] 'cause I think that Jay is the Alfred maestro, if I recall correctly.
[49:59] - Stuff's happening. - Whoa, hey guys, look at that.
[50:11] - Looks good. - Giant now.
[50:16] So hopefully we can see things from there. By the way, I just updated OBS
[50:22] and it does look like yours now. - Yeah, I was just going to say,
[50:27] I checked for updates and there were none. So I think we are good.
[50:31] - No, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're good. - Okay, okay, so there's a lot going on here.
[50:36] - I just had an insight into the old version of OBS. So Jen, you have made a new scene.
[50:43] Now on the way your OBS is set up, on the left, you've got a preview of the scene
[50:49] that you're going to transition to. And on the right, you're seeing what your viewers are seeing.
[50:56] - Oh, okay. - Yeah, so let's create a new scene.
[51:03] You've already done that. You've got scene two there at the bottom left.
[51:09] - It just wouldn't let me delete it. So it had to have something there.
[51:14] So scene two, it's just a blink, everything. - So I guess if I were to do this, I would create,
[51:23] so would I do a different scene for guests then? I think this is where I get really mixed up is like,
[51:37] do I do a scene for like what we're looking at right now? And then a scene like this and then the scene like this,
[51:47] like these are all different scenes that I have to create? - That is correct.
[51:51] - Oh, okay. - So what you lose in terms of like pre-done work,
[51:57] you make up for in customizability. - And I think this is where is I'm like, I don't,
[52:04] okay, I'm going to make a scene. We're going to do it.
[52:06] We're going to do step one, even though I'm still so confused.
[52:11] - It's kind of like with, you know, the Spider-Man, like with great power comes great responsibility.
[52:16] And it's really like with great power comes a lot of fucking work.
[52:21] - Yes, yes. I feel like that should be the update.
[52:24] So I'm going to do. - Let's call this one, let's start simple, Jen.
[52:33] Let's make one, which is just you talking to the camera and the chat.
[52:38] - Okay. - Let's call it, I don't know, just Jen, up to you.
[52:44] - Sounds good. - Yeah.
[52:47] So what are the two things that we're going to need here? We're going to need your camera.
[52:51] - My background and a chat. - Well, yes, but let's, let's start with the camera.
[52:57] I think the camera is going to be like, the essential one here.
[53:04] Yeah. Now you can give it a name or create, yeah.
[53:07] So you're creating a source for the camera. - Why are you not doing that?
[53:15] That was weird. - Okay.
[53:17] - Perfect. - Wow.
[53:24] I am like trying to read and not reading it out loud. I'm like, what does this say?
[53:30] If you are a fan of organization, many streamers add scenes being lines as the name
[53:40] and containing nothing to use this space or between multiple scenes.
[53:46] - That's excellent. - I'm going to go, okay.
[53:52] 'Cause this is the stuff that frustrates me the most is I'm like, logically, everything everyone is saying
[53:58] makes sense, but I'm like, but it doesn't make sense. - I think it's just like a blank screen.
[54:03] - Yeah. - Like if you add no sources to your scene,
[54:07] then your scene is black screen. And so you can use that as like a, like a transition.
[54:14] - Oh. - Like in lieu of a transition,
[54:17] if I'm understanding correctly. - Interesting.
[54:20] - So I'm gonna derail a little more. I think from what I understand is happening
[54:26] is that when you have lots of scenes in a list, like you saw with mine and it's a big mess,
[54:32] if you wanna keep them in groups, you can just have scenes with nothing in them
[54:36] that are called a bunch of lines, just so that list shows these ones
[54:40] that are just a bunch of lines as separators. - It's like a line break in the list is what you're saying.
[54:46] - Correct. - Oh.
[54:47] - That makes sense. - That does make sense.
[54:50] - That's super cool. - So we've got Jen here, we're adding your camera,
[54:53] you can choose. And since this is open source software,
[54:56] you can really go as in-depth as you want, if you wanna specify to the level of like
[55:05] how high you want your camera's resolution to be. - High works.
[55:12] - High works. - Yeah.
[55:15] - Click on okay. - These are the questions that I don't stop and ask,
[55:21] I'm afraid. So now what you see on the left is a preview of your scene.
[55:27] Now, what's the problem? The camera is way bigger than the resolution
[55:32] that you're gonna be streaming. So what I would usually do here is resize it.
[55:37] So exactly. - So bring that, drag that down, drag it back up.
[55:43] - Hold on, I fit in the screen. - Yes.
[55:48] - Oh, look, it has a little lines to like figure out. - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[55:53] That's something that my old version didn't have, do I have it now?
[55:56] Oh my goodness, that's new, fantastic. Okay, cool.
[56:00] So you see there, you can really be as pixel perfect. - It's because there's an odd number of pixels, Jen.
[56:09] - Yeah. - Not you.
[56:11] - It also doesn't let me do like a half one. - A half one?
[56:15] - Like I can only do it. - Integer numbers of pixels.
[56:21] - Yeah, like it will only resize the shape it's at, it won't let me show half of the scene, half of like-
[56:28] - You wanna crop your camera? - Yeah, if I wanted to crop the camera.
[56:33] - Jen, remember what we're dealing with here. Open software, the power is yours.
[56:39] You can literally take a window, say you're sharing a window and just like cover your face,
[56:44] cover half the camera. - Oh, I'll bet that there's a plugin too,
[56:49] like an OBS plugin that will let you crop without having to just like stick something on your face.
[56:57] - Or as Daphne De Bergen says, you can hold the Alt key while resizing.
[57:03] - Ooh, that crops? - Yeah, that's a cropping.
[57:06] - Whoa, that's... - I will do that here shortly, hold on.
[57:13] - Let's bring in the background. - Yeah, there's...
[57:16] No. No.
[57:25] Don't mind me, y'all. - You're good.
[57:30] - I'm just trying to find a background. Oh, we're so close, but not any of those.
[57:35] What about these? Okay, here we go.
[57:37] That's what I was looking for. And my face is gone,
[57:40] which I believe if I just drag this on top, yay. So y'all, what I did just so that way
[57:49] I can also explain is when I added the background, it added it to the top.
[57:58] So what I had to do is drag and drop my camera on top of it. - Cool.
[58:05] - Hold on, alt. - Wait, what is alt?
[58:10] - I think it's called option. Yeah, it's option.
[58:14] - Okay. - There you go.
[58:18] - Nice. Okay, that was exciting, thank you.
[58:25] This is exciting. Okay, so I got this going and let's add...
[58:31] - What else do we want to add? - I think we need our, well, general, yeah.
[58:36] Do it. - Is that Leopold?
[58:49] - That is Leopold. See you later, dear Fundenberg, and thanks for everything.
[58:53] - Yes, thank you so much. - That is Leopold.
[58:57] It is dinner time, so. - Oh, he's letting you know.
[59:01] - He's letting us know. - Mm-hmm.
[59:03] - What happened there? Ah, good, so you've got your microphone.
[59:07] It is your Yeti. - Well, it didn't...
[59:11] - Sorry, I was looking away for a second. - Discard, I guess.
[59:16] Discard? - Yeah, you got to discard properties for Yeti.
[59:19] - That was weird. - That is weird.
[59:22] - I don't know what I was discarding, but... - I was like, you know, worst case,
[59:25] I could just start from scratch. - All right, so we got a mic, we got a camera.
[59:31] - Yeah. - We got the things.
[59:33] - So this scene is ready. This scene is ready,
[59:40] and if you click on transition at the top, that's now what the viewer sees.
[59:46] Now, what's cool about this mode that you have that I cannot for the life of me figure out
[59:50] how to get back on mine, but that's a separate topic, is that you can arrange a scene,
[59:57] like in the background, say if you want to last minute put something in,
[60:01] while you're still streaming on a different scene. Does that make sense?
[60:08] - Yes, I know. - It's like Git add before Git commit.
[60:19] - Uh-oh, Ryan got a clip. Am I making a funny face?
[60:29] Oh yes, yes I am, yes, yes I am. You can share that, go ahead and tweet it.
[60:35] D&D has so much fun when I make funny faces and they screenshot it when I play D&D.
[60:41] - Love it. - I will tag Roy and he'll crack up.
[60:48] Channel name is, oh, let me do this, hold on. I am using, I remember this being pretty easy to set up,
[60:56] so I'm just, oh, this is throwing me off. Please, Git.
[61:03] - Sorry, what are we doing next? - I think this is Ben's chat,
[61:08] Ben's version of like Chaterino. - Oh, fab, yeah.
[61:12] - Ben Myers. - Who's just a joy, how much do we love Ben?
[61:17] - I love Ben. That's why I'm like, I really want to show you guys this,
[61:21] because I was messing around with it, but you can do-- - Look at all this customizability.
[61:26] - Forget Chaterino, I'm gonna start using ShowMy.chat. - The only reason that I decided
[61:32] I was going to end up sticking with Chaterino is because I don't see an option in ShowMy.chat
[61:38] to keep a transcript. - Oh.
[61:41] - Chaterino does that? - That was the only, Chaterino does?
[61:45] Yeah, you showed us like 20 minutes ago. - No, I was doing that for the captions,
[61:49] not for Chaterino. - Oh, no, no, no, never mind, don't listen to me.
[61:55] Don't listen to me. - Wow, you can even customize it to look like Minecraft.
[62:00] What? - Yeah, so there's like these different themes.
[62:04] - Oh yeah, I'm stealing this. Thank you, Ben.
[62:09] - Trying to figure out the one that I liked last time. - Let's shout them out, Ben D. Myers.
[62:16] - Yeah, Ben is the best. - Go follow this excellent person, everyone.
[62:21] - Yes. - And Ben has a channel, Twitch channel.
[62:27] I can't comment publicly today for some reason. So if somebody can link to Ben's Twitch,
[62:32] that would be great. - Is it the same one, Ben D. Myers?
[62:36] - No, I think it's- - It might be SomeAnticsDev.
[62:40] - Yeah, SomeAnticsDev, SomeDevAnt. I always get them mixed up.
[62:45] - I'm gonna go on their Twitter, SomeAnticsDev. - Okay.
[62:51] Oh, I haven't activated it. Okay.
[62:54] - I just realized the pun, some antics. - Yes.
[62:59] - It's good. - And then you can like clear messages
[63:03] or show latest messages. And then you open OBS, copy overlay.
[63:11] And then for source URL. - Yeah, the Animal Crossing one is really good.
[63:21] So I think that might be, oh yeah. - Okay.
[63:31] And then source URL. - Hold on, hold on, Jen.
[63:35] You didn't delete the rest. There's still some OBS stuff.
[63:38] Why don't you just, yeah. - I hate that it does that.
[63:41] Okay, there we go. And then-
[63:45] - When I hit okay. - So now we need people in the chat, if you would please.
[63:51] Do what you do best. - Let's-
[63:57] - In Jen's chat, not mine. - Yeah.
[63:59] But I think, I think I forgot something. - We still need a background for it, I believe.
[64:07] - Oh. Maybe you're right.
[64:19] - Let me go back to- - I got impatient.
[64:24] - Yeah, you do a new source. - That looks good.
[64:34] - Oh, is it? No, it's at the top.
[64:38] - Should it be at the top? Yeah, it should be at the top.
[64:43] - Bottom, just in case. Nope.
[64:47] - Okay. - We got that working last time.
[64:51] - Right, definitely keep it visible. More chat.
[64:55] Well, let's- - Oh, no, that wouldn't be it.
[65:01] - Can you open up the properties? - Yes.
[65:05] Let's see what we got. Show my chat.
[65:08] Wait, wait, go up, go up real quick. Teaching tech, question mark, theme, animal.
[65:16] Is that, looks correct. - Re-paste it.
[65:20] - Width, height, use custom frame rate, control audio via OBS.
[65:26] Body, background color. You can customize the background color there.
[65:28] That's pretty cool. Right now, the background color is...
[65:32] Change that last zero to a one, please. That's gonna make it...
[65:38] Hold on, I'm bad at colors. Is all zeros black or white?
[65:43] - I don't know. It should change the color either way.
[65:46] - True. Hit okay.
[65:48] Didn't change anything. Oh, all right.
[65:52] Bring the chat back, folks. Let's keep it going.
[65:55] Hello, chat. Okay, well, it's not doing it yet, which is...
[66:03] - It'll take a few seconds. - Yeah, maybe, Jen, you wanna refresh the...
[66:08] - Here, not what I meant to show you guys. I just like to click random things.
[66:11] - Property, like there was a toggle in the properties to refresh when the scene changes or something.
[66:20] I guess the scene didn't change, but... - Refresh browser when scene becomes active.
[66:25] Yeah, put that in and refresh the cache, just in case you can never go wrong with that.
[66:33] Cool. Hello.
[66:35] - I want this. - I'm going to...
[66:41] - Chat, chat, chat. Brian, please help me.
[66:45] - Change to just the default and I'll add it as an additional one.
[66:52] - Do you know what? This is a really good way to get engagement on Twitch.
[67:00] It's like, oh no, we're debugging our chat. Oh no, everyone's gonna have to chat so much.
[67:04] (laughing) - Well, thank you guys.
[67:07] You know, I'm really wanting to get over 200, so thank you. - Next time we need to debug my chat.
[67:16] - Yes, I agree. (laughing)
[67:20] - Oh, Bakari says it would be really cool if we all met for coffee IRL one day.
[67:25] - Yes, I agree. - I wouldn't mind.
[67:27] - Dude, why is it not showing? - Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[67:30] - I don't know where. - Chat, chat, chat.
[67:33] Everybody chat. - No, and what I remember last time is it totally did.
[67:39] It showed up by itself. - But where to meet Seattle here?
[67:45] Yeah, see, I'm in Central Europe. - I'm in the San Francisco Bay Area.
[67:51] So at least, I mean, same coast. That's something.
[67:54] - I'm in Denver. I'm at least in the States.
[67:56] - So I think it's only fair. Iceland.
[68:00] - Yes. - Yes.
[68:04] Defaults. And then if I go back.
[68:06] - Bakari, you're in the Bay Area? Because I'm in the Bay Area.
[68:12] So we could at least have two of us meet up for coffee. - I'm gonna need to see a photo, please.
[68:19] When that happens. - He is very good at taking photos.
[68:22] Bakari and Ian took photos and sent it to me and it made me, so the URL works.
[68:28] - Yo, yo, yo, hold up, hold up. That looks different.
[68:31] - It's a different link. I put in Twitch to try to put something there.
[68:37] - So wait, we've got our stream inside the stream? That is?
[68:40] - Different. - Inception.
[68:42] I put it in Twitch to try to put something there. - The sound changed.
[68:51] - It didn't change. It's bringing in the audio from Twitch.
[68:55] It's not echoing. Because Jen put in Twitch,
[69:00] we're now getting the audio from that. - Yeah.
[69:03] - It didn't change. It's bringing in the audio from the left.
[69:06] - Hey, that's like doing weird things in my head. - It's changing now.
[69:10] (Jen laughs) - Did it stop?
[69:12] - It's getting the audio from that. Yeah.
[69:15] - No. - Why is this still going?
[69:19] I turned it off. - You made it invisible, but not inaudible.
[69:22] - Oh. - So you might wanna remove it.
[69:25] Sir. - Why is this still going?
[69:30] Okay, Inception is stopped. - Yes.
[69:33] - But ShowMyDotChat is still not. Interact.
[69:43] - How frustrating. Like, I wonder why we can't get it to work.
[69:48] We've gotta be doing something wrong. Do you know what?
[69:51] Do you wanna maybe hop back to mine and see if I can get it to...
[69:55] - Yeah. - I wanna get it working here.
[69:59] Let's have a look. Double-click on it again, please, Jen.
[70:04] Sorry, not double-click. Bring us the properties.
[70:08] Yes. Ryan's in my chat saying, "Hola, hola, hola."
[70:14] - So let me look at the documentation 'cause I helped with this at one point.
[70:23] - Control audio. - Oh, yeah.
[70:29] - Plus sign, browser, chat overlay. You can paste it.
[70:35] Choose a height and width, hit okay. Oh, I'm really glad I read the documentation.
[70:43] - Did we miss something? Wait, what?
[70:48] - Wait, where was that documentation? - Yeah, sorry.
[70:54] I will go there. I just wanna see if it works.
[70:57] - Yeah, so it seems to work, but that's a demo now.
[70:59] It's not our chat. It's not your chat.
[71:03] - Yeah, but just to start, it's- - Oh, Jen, I have a different idea, if I may.
[71:09] - Yes. - Take the URL that we're putting into OBS.
[71:12] Let's put it in the browser. - Okay.
[71:16] - Because in theory, yeah. Wait, that's Show My Chat again.
[71:21] - Because it should be- - I like Show My Chat.
[71:23] I am... Why did I never try this?
[71:28] Stop trying to go back. Okay, copy chat overlay.
[71:31] - Yeah, bring that in here. - Oh, y'all, I think I know what it is.
[71:35] - Is it an @? Do you know what it is?
[71:37] - No, it's my channel name. - Oh, no.
[71:40] (laughs) - No, it's my channel name.
[71:43] (laughs) - And this is why I will forever curse myself
[71:50] for putting an extra underscore in HolaSoyMilk for the Twitch, but HolaSoyMilk was taken.
[71:57] (sighs) What?
[72:00] Stop, delete it all. Delete, thank you.
[72:04] Okay. - Bring it back, folks.
[72:06] Bring back the chat, chat, chat, chat. - Look, it's there.
[72:11] - Cool. Now let's get the Animal Crossing one.
[72:14] - Yay. - I want the Animal Crossing one.
[72:17] - You want the Animal Crossing one? Okay.
[72:19] - Yes, please. - Hold on.
[72:21] Go back here. - So what we're essentially doing
[72:25] is embedding a browser, like a tiny browser, into our scene.
[72:30] - Which one? - I should do that.
[72:35] Sorry, Animalese. - Oh, thank you.
[72:39] I'm like, I don't see Animal Crossing. There we go.
[72:43] - I think Nintendo might not want them to call it Animalese, if I'm honest.
[72:47] (hums) - We might even be able to make it transparent now
[72:58] and just keep, because, you know, each little thingy has their own background.
[73:02] - Oh, yeah. - Maybe change that one back to a zero.
[73:04] (hums) - And then I just need to make it.
[73:12] - Make it happen, folks. Chat.
[73:14] Oh, that's so good. That's so good.
[73:19] And also, yay, I'm purple. - Oh my goodness, that's so cool.
[73:23] - I want the width to be half of that. So we're getting progress.
[73:28] Hit okay. Hey!
[73:30] And then-- - So that's how people make their chat look fancy.
[73:37] Thank you, Jen. I'm switching over from Chatterino.
[73:39] - There, and this could go here. And this could.
[73:51] I feel like it's, I need that. Yay, look at all of that.
[73:55] We got it working, yay. - Fabulous.
[73:58] - This seems not great. Well, we'll work on that.
[74:03] - Well, I mean, this is both the wonderful and terrible thing of this.
[74:08] The layout's up to you. - I want them.
[74:19] Shh. That doesn't help me.
[74:25] Oh, it might. Let me do height.
[74:30] Now I'm like way too concentrated on this. And then, whee!
[74:39] If I do this, and do this, do, do, do, do, do. - Now, it might look small here,
[74:47] but remember, this is everything you're gonna see in the stream.
[74:50] So I think that size is fine. Okay, cool.
[74:55] - Stop grabbing the background. - What you wanna grab?
[74:59] - This, and it was grabbing the background. So, okay, if I make this like my default scene.
[75:05] - Do you wanna maybe put in like, and you can see, you've got that flexibility
[75:10] to put in as much as you want. You can, for example, if you want,
[75:14] put your captions below your photo. - If you wanna do open captions.
[75:20] - I do wanna do captions. So let's do the captions.
[75:24] - That will require a restart to OBS, because we need to install the captions plugin.
[75:29] Is that cool? - I don't care.
[75:31] Also, I'm just gonna time check everybody, 'cause I'm off in La La Land,
[75:35] and enjoying trying to do this. - Do have a start stop at the top of the hour, I'm afraid.
[75:41] - Okay. All right, well, what I'll do then,
[75:46] if y'all are okay with it, is I will stop streaming to your channels when you leave,
[75:52] and just keep going. So that way I actually get this done.
[75:57] 'Cause I feel like the momentum is going. I don't wanna stop the momentum.
[76:00] - Total thing. - So, well, let's do one thing before I have to go, Jen.
[76:04] Let's make you a new scene. - Oh, yes, yes, yes.
[76:07] - Oh, and Suze is asking, can you choose how many speech bubbles to show,
[76:12] or will it always show the last five comments? So, Suze, in ShowMyDotChat,
[76:18] you'll get like a bunch of customization options before, yeah, what you see here,
[76:24] and there you see show latest messages, or clear messages after a certain amount of seconds.
[76:29] So you have that customizability there. But that's a good question, thank you.
[76:36] - Default is a hundred. - There you go.
[76:42] I think it also, I would need to change, and this is just gonna be a lot of the customization,
[76:51] 'cause I think if I were to go up to like 600 instead, it'll make them thinner.
[76:59] And it's more of like that kind of thing, that I just need to figure out the right dimensions
[77:05] to make it work. - Cool.
[77:09] - So, here we go, and so, oh, well, keep going, keep going. So something like this may work better,
[77:26] so that way people can see the entire conversation. Yeah, but it's just, you know,
[77:35] if I wanted to keep them going, but yes, we were talking about making another scene.
[77:39] - Yeah, so here's the thing, hold on a second, hold on a second.
[77:42] - Yes. - It's a bit of a, it would be quite annoying to,
[77:47] it'd be quite annoying to have to remake that entire scene bit for bit, so why not take Just Jen,
[77:57] right click on it, and duplicate. - Oh, okay, and then I would say.
[78:05] - What do you want to put here, a screen share? What are you thinking?
[78:08] - That is Jen screen share, that is gonna be what it's called. - Now, this is where things are gonna get real,
[78:20] like if you thought we were inceptioning before, just you wait, folks, 'cause now, what's up, Jen?
[78:27] - Nothing. - Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry,
[78:31] I just wanted to make sure I didn't lose, I didn't wanna make sure that I didn't, yeah, sorry.
[78:39] - You're doing something, sorry, you're amazing, and please, everyone, tell Ramon how amazing he is,
[78:48] 'cause I feel like we don't tell Ramon that, and you have three of me telling you, it's true.
[78:54] - You can't do it on my, you can't do it in my chat, though. (laughing)
[78:58] I'm kidding, I'm kidding, sorry, you're all very kind. Cool, so this is right now our Just Jen screen share,
[79:06] now what we can do is start customizing it to make this a screen share enabled scene,
[79:12] so I think we wanna do macOS screen capture, and let's call it, well, actually macOS screen capture
[79:20] is pretty accurate, in my opinion. - It is, but I'm gonna put screen share,
[79:24] or I might get confused. - Okay.
[79:32] - Yeah, this is what I meant by inception, what's going on, you are screen sharing your screen share,
[79:40] so. - There you go, yeah.
[79:44] - Oh, yeah, that works. - The insides of Twitch.
[79:46] - So you can click on okay now, and just like you've done before,
[79:50] you can move the layout around. - Okay, hey, this is gonna be super unstuck,
[79:58] so, and I know that I need to like figure out like something I wanna figure out y'all is ping,
[80:08] here, I'm gonna go back to all of us really quick. That one, no, no, there we go, thank you.
[80:16] - The close ups. We're coming from live, this looks like news,
[80:22] this looks like we have to share our opinion on the news. - I feel like, there we go,
[80:26] I gotta get like really far back. This is throwing me off.
[80:34] - I think if I may use my executive power here, I'll bring us back here, if that's okay.
[80:39] - Thank you, 'cause like seeing my face that close, I'm like, yeah.
[80:43] So I'm gonna continue streaming and work on doing this. So in ad ping, which ping is a way for guests to join,
[80:57] it is something that I'll go into that after they leave, it's kinda cool, I'll explain, I'll show you guys next week.
[81:05] Well, Ramon, you don't have to join the stream if you don't want to, you can also join the chat
[81:13] and at least see it. - No, it's Tuesday, this is gonna be like my last week
[81:17] of streaming because after that, I'm off to Chile for three weeks,
[81:20] so I will be a little bit off the grid. - Okay, you will have to watch it video on demand.
[81:26] - Or be closer to your time zones. - Yes, that is gonna be weird.
[81:31] - Folks, it's been a joy, thank you for having me. See you soon.
[81:37] - Bye, y'all. - Bye. - See ya.
[81:39] - Okay, and for everyone that wants to continue hanging out with me, please go to my channel,
[81:48] which is Gentanod, if not, I'll give y'all a few minutes just because it's weird to stream
[81:57] to people's channels if they're not here. So I'm gonna do this, let's see,
[82:05] I'm gonna remove remote, make sure it doesn't break anything. Hey, all right, one is done.
[82:18] And, oh, I can do Laura's at the same time. Remove and save changes.
[82:27] Hey, I didn't break stuff. I think we are still streaming, which is exciting.
[82:34] So I, yes, I am going to be working on doing this at the same time and just customizing OBS.
[82:47] I don't know for how long. We'll see how long OBS is gonna take me.
[82:52] So let's get back over to that. And I am gonna customize some stuff really quick before,
[82:59] since I am setting up a screen share to my other screen, and I'm double screen sharing,
[83:07] I just wanna make sure I don't have anything up. That would be a little, not anybody else's business.
[83:15] There we go, that is a very proper way of saying things. Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[83:24] Close this. Okay, don't close this, that's fine.
[83:36] And then, I know, nobody can see the screen yet. I'm getting there.
[83:44] I also might continue, once OBS is set up, I'll work on what I've been hyper-focused at lately,
[83:50] which is my website. It's been a bit much.
[83:55] Okay, cool, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do. Oh, otherwise, you can see a piece of my website.
[84:07] It is the first website I have fully built outside of like Squarespace or WordPress.
[84:15] So it has been interesting. So we need to fully, yeah, Teach Gen T.
[84:24] It is technically Teach Gen Tech, which we will get there. Okay, let me go to screen share and make this smaller.
[84:33] Oh, really quick, before I do this, it always drives me bonkers streaming
[84:41] without some type of music in the background. 'Cause I don't know, it just creeps me out.
[84:47] So this is something that StreamYard has is a set amount of pre-setup music,
[84:59] where we talked about this a bit last week with Ramon, that we need to like use our own music,
[85:08] some places we can get music. I'm not gonna worry about it right now
[85:10] because just having the scene by themselves is gonna be good for it to start.
[85:16] So, and I am very excited that I'm able to see the chat over here too,
[85:23] because half the time when I'm screen sharing, I can't see what chats I'm missing.
[85:29] I feel like this is so weird. So let's, where do you put the chat?
[85:36] I like how Ramon's is set up. So while we're on that topic,
[85:41] I'm going to go to Twitch and go. Do y'all, do any of you have like favorite streamers
[85:51] that you're like, "Oh my gosh, they are so cool." 'Cause I feel like I need to go copy some of their layouts.
[85:59] But that's not Ramon. I just figured it would bring up,
[86:05] (indistinct) Here we go.
[86:09] (humming) No sound, stop with the sound.
[86:17] And I've been on a lot of broadcasts lately. Let's see if there's older videos that are his.
[86:35] (upbeat music) Well, it was in this one earlier,
[86:48] so I will go click through it. All right, this is how Ramon has it set up.
[87:02] So there is a graphic up at the top. He has his chat, his window, and then the screen share,
[87:11] and then I believe captions are underneath that. So I like that idea.
[87:17] This means I need to go create a graphic in Canva because as Ramon has all of these graphics,
[87:33] these aren't things that just come with OBS or with even StreamYard.
[87:41] These are all things that we have to customize. So the one that I have in the background on StreamYard
[87:47] is one that Homie created. So, oh yeah, okay.
[87:54] I'm just trying to think what with Ramon's. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[88:00] Canva. And I'm just gonna go to my default docs
[88:08] because that's what I got. Makes it easier.
[88:12] Okay. And let's do this.
[88:24] Let's do this. I'm kind of lazy when it comes to this kind of stuff.
[88:31] So I just duplicate it and then I'll make it smaller. My mic is in the way so I can't see anything.
[88:39] I do like that Ramon has it at the top, but he also makes his look like a window.
[88:49] (upbeat music) Maybe.
[88:54] Maybe. I like that he has a Twitter icon too.
[89:09] We can do this. I'm gonna put it at the bottom.
[89:21] I feel weird having it at the top. His looks really good at the top,
[89:23] but I don't want mine at the top. Okay.
[89:33] So what are y'all working on today? Because this is something I have so much joy of streaming
[89:44] is I get to just randomly talk to people while I'm working. And when I'm streaming my website stuff,
[89:53] or working on my website stuff, a lot of times I'll just watch other people's streams.
[90:02] So, okay. Elements.
[90:06] I want to add the like Twitter icon and those types of things.
[90:11] So, let me go look for them. Twitter.
[90:18] Let's see. LinkedIn.
[90:20] Why not? We'll just get all of our graphics on there.
[90:23] I'm just adding the first ones, but y'all, you could do like whatever you wanted.
[90:30] Like, look at all these like random ones. Anyway.
[90:33] I think it has a graphic. I feel like that's just gonna start getting too many.
[90:42] Yeah, we'll just leave those too. (upbeat music)
[90:50] What would y'all put for your icons? Would you, do you think that it should just be like
[91:00] Twitter and LinkedIn? Or would you say doing something else?
[91:05] Like Mastodon or TikTok or whatever the cool kids do now. (upbeat music)
[91:15] (upbeat music) Okay.
[91:30] I think this looks good. And, so we scroll to download.
[91:38] We want it as a PNG. We only want this page.
[91:44] (upbeat music) Download.
[91:49] Okay. Then we go back here.
[92:01] And, I wonder if it lets me drag it up. I actually don't know.
[92:08] Let's find out. It does.
[92:11] Oh, that is exciting. Okay.
[92:14] So. Alt.
[92:18] Oh, look at that. Look at that.
[92:21] It worked. I did the Alt.
[92:25] That's the really nice human earlier told us about. Okay.
[92:31] So we got the Alt. And then.
[92:35] Oui. Oui.
[92:38] What else does Ramon have set up? (upbeat music)
[92:44] Captions. We're gonna have to do captions soon.
[92:46] So the screen share. It's like the majority of the screen,
[92:56] which makes sense. So.
[93:00] Not really much room. There isn't just spaced out so well.
[93:12] (upbeat music) Maybe this is too big.
[93:36] (upbeat music) Oh, you were right at the middle.
[93:51] There we go. And then.
[93:54] And that just makes it bigger. (upbeat music)
[93:59]. Okay.
[94:17] Well, I am gonna slowly start, keep adjusting this randomly.
[94:23] I hope y'all are having fun watching it. I bet it's super, super exciting.
[94:31] I'm gonna make this back to normal. Oh, you know what?
[94:38] Undo, undo, undo, undo, undo, undo, undo. There we go.
[94:44] As we can have this be, have a border.
[94:51] These. And then.
[94:56] Let's see. Ramon has the chat.
[95:02] So I'll have to adjust that size. All right, move my face.
[95:10] Oh, does the alt work on this too? Oh, it does.
[95:25] Okay, look how happy that is. I'm not gonna lie though.
[95:30] I feel like this isn't really my style of chat. Like, I used to like it.
[95:36] This is the one that I originally wanted to go with, but now I'm like, I don't know if I really like it.
[95:41] But, yeah. Go to camera.
[95:47] Here we go. You know, I think I'm gonna,
[95:55] oh, I'm gonna try a different chat. Where is all my windows?
[96:01] I'll try it over here. Oh, yeah, that's true.
[96:08] That's true. I do think it looks cool when it's not so thin.
[96:12] Let's try. Oh, wrong one.
[96:17] Um. Oh.
[96:25] That didn't work. Ah!
[96:38] Oh, I got the wheel of death. Please go away, wheel of death.
[96:53] Computer did not like that. OBS did not like that at all.
[97:03] I don't even know if you guys can still see things. (soft music)
[97:09] Yeah, OBS is just having so much fun spinning. Please go back, OBS.
[97:24] What if I, no, no. All right, let's see.
[97:32] I have to Google the force quit. I haven't had to do it in a while, which is nice.
[97:41] Very grateful for that. I guess I'll just do it from here.
[97:52] Force quit. Okay, hi.
[97:58] We're getting there. And I always forget what all these icons mean.
[98:04] It's not exactly the best way. Yay, you're working.
[98:11] Oh. Just done.
[98:15] Oh. Okay, let's do.
[98:26] All right, Susan and 1,200 and what? I think I'm like 400.
[98:33] Let me try it. Why are you not showing though?
[98:42] What? How did I break you again?
[98:54] I'm gonna start from scratch on you. Ding, ding, ding.
[99:05] And. Do, do, do.
[99:16] (upbeat music) I am in the screen share one.
[99:29] I'm gonna call this chat. Make source visible.
[99:45] Let's try 400 or 600, sure. I'm gonna chat with myself, y'all.
[99:57] I'm gonna be a weirdo, unless anybody else wants to send me a chat.
[100:01] See if it works. Yay, it worked.
[100:16] Okay, I don't think it looks bad here. I think it's 'cause I don't necessarily like the colors.
[100:23] But I could go try to customize that later. That's fine.
[100:29] So. Is this still gonna be?
[100:40] Oh, I don't wanna change the height. I wanna change the width.
[100:44] (upbeat music) I almost wanted it to be a square.
[100:56] Okay, and then the camera. Maybe not.
[101:05] (upbeat music) [101:08], okay.
[101:09], 19, 20, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30. (upbeat music)
[101:19] 19. 19, 20.
[101:46] (upbeat music) 10, 80 by.
[101:50] 19, 20. I did that totally backwards.
[102:06] And hello, hello. How's your Monday going?
[102:13] (upbeat music) Oh, dude, I get the need for coffee.
[102:38] I totally get that. This is the one I wanna get.
[102:42] (upbeat music) I'm having fun trying to figure out OBS
[102:51] and how I want all of my scenes set up. Isn't Ryan so cool?
[103:00] (upbeat music) [103:02], we're gonna see, oh, oh, that might work.
[103:07] I can see you sent a message. Someone sent a message.
[103:34] I will be there shortly. Hey, there we go.
[103:41] Oh, the top coolest, nice. Okay, so, like this isn't exactly.
[103:59] You can wear that. (upbeat music)
[104:04] Stop trying to snap into places. This is annoying.
[104:13] (upbeat music) Use smaller, okay.
[104:25] (upbeat music) And, oh, thank you, Seuss.
[104:33] Yes, I hope so. This is such a fiddly process,
[104:45] but you think it's worth the effort in the end. I hope so, I hope so.
[104:49] This is definitely something that is very annoying to me, but this is another reason why I wanna do it
[104:55] is if somebody comments something, everybody can see it in the chat up above
[105:00] instead of me having to like remember to be like, oh, wait a minute.
[105:05] 'Cause that is something that I definitely saw by watching other people's streams,
[105:10] like the bigger streamers that they were doing. I was like, that's pretty sweet.
[105:17] All right, let's see what I can break with. (upbeat music)
[105:26] Yay, thank you, thank you. Hello, everyone.
[105:32] My name is Jen, this is Teach Jen Tech, and I am working on streaming,
[105:38] setting up, blah, words. I'm working on setting up OBS to stream.
[105:46] And it is definitely something that is, I feel like everyone else could probably say
[105:53] this that it's kind of a pain to set up, at least at the beginning, and then it's pretty cool.
[106:01] But I don't know if anybody else would say that, but hello, hello.
[106:06] Once again, thank you for the raid. Come hang out, follow, all the good stuff, ask questions.
[106:15] And okay. (upbeat music)
[106:23] I know that I want to do the captions. So now I have to go see where I put it.
[106:31] So we're gonna stop screen sharing for a minute, 'cause I have a feeling that I put it in my notes,
[106:37] and I don't really wanna show all my notes to you guys. I did put it in my notes, at least maybe where it was.
[106:45] Easy to find. (upbeat music)
[106:50] ♪ Do, do, do, do, do, do ♪ ♪ Do, do, do, do, do, do ♪
[106:57] Back to sharing my screen. And at the moment, if y'all want new music,
[107:08] I can try to find something other than "Feed the Ducks," but they all kind of loop, so.
[107:14] Okay. Close, captioning.
[107:19] (upbeat music) Not gonna mess this up.
[107:22] One thing y'all may realize is I'm not the best at going and reading all the directions.
[107:34] I'm always like, "I wanna figure it out by myself. "It'll be fine."
[107:37] And then I go read the directions. It's, you know, I know it's a thing.
[107:42] I do know that it's a thing. Oh, see?
[107:46] And it didn't work, so now I actually have to go read the directions.
[107:52] Okay. Plugin.
[107:56] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[108:01] (laughs) Well, thank you, thank you.
[108:28] I'm glad you hear that because I'm always like, "Eh, it'll happen, it'll happen."
[108:33] I also found that something that I'm working over, working on getting over for streaming
[108:39] is the fact that, in general, I hate that I have to do this,
[108:45] but I don't always, like, I skip a lot of words and I've been learning that a lot of it has to do
[108:53] with being dyslexic, which, cool, great, that's cool, but I like, I don't like listening to the page
[108:59] because text-to-speech is huge for me, yes, but I'm like, "I don't wanna do that when in stream."
[109:05] And, yeah, I feel very silly doing it. I was just like, "Oh, let me do the actual read
[109:15] these features, notes." You can enable and disable the caption preview doc
[109:25] in, oh, interesting. And if anybody wants to follow along,
[109:53] we did post this earlier, but I just wanna make sure that, you know,
[109:57] not leaving anybody behind. This is the link that we are using for the closed captions.
[110:04] And what the closed captions do is they make it so as the stream is live, it will make closed captions.
[110:10] Okay, installation, not Windows, installation, okay. Extract the zip, copy and paste that into Plugins folder.
[110:25] Aha, see, it does help to try to read the directions. So we're going to get a big,
[110:46] and then we are going to go to file into the Plugins in the OBS Studio setting folder.
[111:02] Oh, close it. Well, you guys don't need to see what's up.
[111:06] Just kidding. I need to like take those, put them somewhere else.
[111:13] OBS. Oh yes, yes, yes.
[111:21] Alan, totally, like that is my life. I will say something that I've learned
[111:27] because Laura and I stream on every other Friday. We stream on Python, about Python.
[111:40] And then the opposite Fridays I stream with Josh Goldberg about TypeScript.
[111:46] And what we do is set it up that I have the book itself so I can take notes, but I do a text to speech
[111:56] to be able to read the documentation. But then I have pretty things like this.
[112:02] So it's definitely been since streaming for the last six months,
[112:08] I've learned a lot about how I learn and how to really pay attention to the content.
[112:14] Settings, I might have missed a step, but we're going to move video recording, stream display.
[112:26] This is not what it said. Extract the zip, copy and paste that.
[112:37] A cloud closed captions, plug in file into the folder in the OBS studio settings folder.
[112:44] Oh, I read it as going to the OBS and open settings, which doesn't make sense.
[112:52] So that's a weird view. Applications, OBS, we're going to see
[112:59] if I can do it this way. I'll probably have to go.
[113:04] No, okay, fine, fine, fine. I will do it the proper way.
[113:08] I don't want to do it the proper way. Applications, applications.
[113:18] (indistinct) No package contents, contents, plugins, new file.
[113:31] (upbeat music) I'm being blind, being blind.
[113:46] I do not see new. (upbeat music)
[113:49] File, new folder, new, can't I just drag and drop it? Like, why do I have to copy and paste it?
[114:02] I feel like that's just making my life more confusing. So we're going to see if this works
[114:05] and just drag and drop it. Cool, it's over there.
[114:09] And file show settings folder. Yep, okay, your OBS folder plugins.
[114:19] That's it, restart OBS. Okay, restart OBS.
[114:27] See if we have any luck. (upbeat music)
[114:31] And click on settings in the new captions preview. Wait, there should now be a cloud closed captions option
[114:46] in the bottom tools menu. Where's tools?
[114:51] Tools, no, tools, settings. That's interesting.
[114:58] I don't know what the bottom tools menu is, but let's go, correct.
[115:06] (upbeat music) Oh, that's cool.
[115:15] Tools, closed captions. Enable captions.
[115:29] Settings. Caption source.
[115:39] Like, I know I can do it with my mic. I guess I'll do it that way for now
[115:48] since it's just me streaming. And then I can figure it out from there later.
[115:53] Okay, is there, let's... Hi, there we, no, hey.
[116:00] Okay, I'm guessing there's no save. That's what I'm getting at.
[116:03] That's why I'm trying to go down. Eh?
[116:06] Hello? Hello?
[116:10] No, you're not picking up anything. Maybe if I close you?
[116:13] I don't, I don't think it, I don't think I like that. Oh, streamings is right here.
[116:22] Not streaming, CC off. Wait, I thought I just did that.
[116:26] My mic is also right here, so I'm just, you know. Okay, closed captions.
[116:36] It's enabled. Off, on, off, okay.
[116:42] Caption source. Yeti.
[116:47] Profanity filter, off. Yay.
[116:52] Streaming local recordings. Let's see if that helps.
[116:57] Add punctuation. We can turn on Safe's transcripts.
[117:09] Yay. I don't know what I just did, but sure.
[117:20] Caption will, oh, did I mute myself? I might've muted myself when I accidentally inceptioned us.
[117:29] Maybe that's why it doesn't like me at the moment, but it has.
[117:33] Audio right there. Is it the music?
[117:46] Do not like the music. I will turn off the music.
[117:50] It's awkward, but I'll turn it off. I just want this to work.
[118:00] So it says, off. Caption source, yet, oh.
[118:16] No. Why is it not saving this?
[118:22] There's no Save button. There is no Save button.
[118:29] So why are you not saving? You look like you're supposed to scroll down there.
[118:39] I'm gonna move it to another screen just to see. No, you're not gonna let me move you out of OBS.
[118:46] Okay, we'll move OBS to a different, maybe. Excuse me.
[118:52] Rude. Why are you not going to another screen?
[119:08] Oh, for anybody that is using Mac, I just got a new tool called Rectangle
[119:21] and it's really dope because I can actually, I don't think it'll do it here,
[119:30] but like on this side, I can have it lock into place or at the top and it makes it full size.
[119:36] Oh, y'all, I think I need to do this. (silence)
[119:43] Media source. Would it be a media source?
[119:58] No. (silence)
[120:05] I would like this to work so I can turn my music back on.
[120:34] Captioning enabled. Will not caption the source when it's muted or not streamed.
[120:42] Oh, but we'll still caption if volume is turned really low or nothing.
[120:48] I don't, I don't think Ramon was streaming.
[121:01] Weird. Okay, well, I'm going to put a pin in this
[121:04] and we'll ask Ramon later. Let me turn my cool music back on.
[121:14] By cool music, I just mean it is not me just talking to myself.
[121:21] Maybe we'll try this one. We'll be daydreaming now.
[121:26] I dig it. Okay, so I feel like this one's pretty well set up.
[121:33] I'm actually going to delete. Yeah, I'm going to delete this one.
[121:44] Move. Yes.
[121:49] And then, I want to do
[121:58] multiple guess. (upbeat music)
[122:06] Hmm. Let's see.
[122:31] I do. I don't want another screen share.
[122:34] I want another camera. Just to,
[122:37] I feel like it is a browser source. Make source visible.
[122:50] Is this the same source? No.
[123:00] Okay. (upbeat music)
[123:04] We got a second. So y'all, I'm using a tool called Ping,
[123:15] which, here we go.
[123:25] Let me go ahead and link it. (upbeat music)
[123:31] While it's signing in, I'm just making a do it on the other.
[123:57] I'll do sign. Okay.
[124:01] Oh, we can have it ask questions. Oh, that's fun.
[124:05] Okay. That is not what we're looking for.
[124:07] Although that would be fun. Let's try to make this a little easier to read.
[124:13] Oh. That's not what I want.
[124:19] I want Ping. Regular Ping.
[124:25] Oh, I hit check it out instead of my dashboard. What do you know?
[124:31] Okay. So, basically what happens is
[124:36] we can do join room
[124:42] and we will set it up on another camera.
[124:49] We'll set it up on FaceTime, which you can't see, but that's okay.
[124:53] And we will, oh.
[124:56] Oh, it doesn't have that one, but it has this one.
[125:00] My iPhone microphone. I wonder if I can set this up.
[125:03] This song is really annoying in case anybody wanted to know.
[125:15] I'm enjoying it. (soft music)
[125:20] Let's see. Video.
[125:27] How did I figure this out last time? Oh, whatever.
[125:36] We'll have it be this mic. Ooh.
[125:44] Okay. Even though you don't want to do the camera.
[125:50] Whatever. Join the call.
[125:53] Meet myself. So, what this is gonna do is
[126:01] I can go ping to participants
[126:05] and copy a quick embed link.
[126:09] So, if I go here and I go to guest one, I don't know if it actually did it.
[126:18] Here we go. And then it is
[126:22] 1920 by 1080.
[126:28] Okay. You get at least the same size as mine.
[126:43] There we go. But it's not showing anything.
[126:48] (soft music) Resin.
[126:59] There we go. Why is it not showing up?
[127:15] (soft music) I mean, we can make it do the same camera.
[127:22] Oh, it did show up. Yay.
[127:24] That's why. That's not gonna confuse me at all.
[127:29] Cameras on cameras on cameras. And let's do this one.
[127:40] Okay. So, it'll help me know which one is which.
[127:48] So, I'm setting up the full layer that I wanna do
[127:55] because I want it to be able to break down each.
[128:03] So that way, no one can really tell the difference. So, we will undo this.
[128:13] So, that means this needs to be a little higher. This one needs to be a little higher.
[128:19] This one needs to be lower. Or a bit smaller, if it's guessed.
[128:23] (soft music) Okay.
[128:29] I don't know, maybe the chat should be smaller. (soft music)
[128:35] There. (soft music)
[128:45] That's good. I think.
[128:47] Sure. Sure.
[128:50] (soft music) And then, we need to do WordPingo.
[128:58] Might have to hit them up really quick to upgrade my account because
[129:06] I was doing this at some point and then I
[129:13] got distracted and stopped, is the easiest way of saying it.
[129:20] Okay. (soft music)
[129:24] Maybe. (soft music)
[129:27] Thanks for hanging out, Ryan. (soft music)
[129:35] Why am I not screen sharing? (soft music)
[129:42] There we go. So, in Ping, what I'm doing right now is
[130:00] they can give you, oh, okay, they were giving me the links.
[130:08] So, that way you can have the different parts, but in beds.
[130:14] See, it just has me, it doesn't have my screen share. So, let's see if they can,
[130:22] if I can love them really quick. (soft music)
[130:27] We have movement, at least. There is movement.
[130:30] We're just gonna go back to me while I hit them up.
[130:33] (soft music) Let's see.
[130:37] (soft music) Let's see.
[130:40] (soft music) I'm also taking a second just to reply
[130:49] to all the people that have messaged me. 'Cause I'm streaming a lot longer than I normally do.
[130:55] (soft music) Yeah.
[130:57] (soft music) Do, do, do.
[131:00] (soft music) This is it.
[131:08] This might be it. No, that's not it.
[131:10] Going through Discord, 'cause everybody has different Discord icons
[131:14] and I don't remember what any of them are. (soft music)
[131:18] This is it. Yay.
[131:19] (soft music) (soft music)
[131:24] (soft music) (soft music)
[131:29] (soft music) (soft music)
[131:34] (soft music) (soft music)
[131:39] (soft music) I think it's here.
[131:42] (soft music) (soft music)
[131:47] (soft music) (soft music)
[131:52] (soft music) (soft music)
[131:56] (soft music) (soft music)
[132:01] (soft music) (soft music)
[132:06] (soft music) All right.
[132:10] Well, we are paused for now. (soft music)
[132:15] (soft music) And hopefully some people will reply soon.
[132:19] Who might not? And that's totally okay.
[132:23] That is the coolness for things
[132:29] of trying startups is, you know,
[132:34] there's only so much they can do all at once. (soft music)
[132:39] (soft music) (soft music)
[132:43] Oh. (soft music)
[132:46] Oh. (soft music)
[132:50] (soft music) (soft music)
[132:54] I might have. (soft music)
[132:58] (soft music) (soft music)
[133:03] (soft music) I might have just broken up.
[133:07] (soft music) (soft music)
[133:11] (soft music) (soft music)
[133:16] (soft music) (soft music)
[133:21] (soft music) (soft music)
[133:26] (soft music) I know I'm not showing you guys anything.
[133:30] I'm currently trying to see if they reply,
[133:37] but also if I can get it working, which is, you know, boring.
[133:41] Give me a second. Hopefully I'll be back soon.
[133:46] (soft music) (soft music)
[133:51] (soft music) (soft music)
[133:56] (soft music) (soft music)
[134:01] (soft music) Oh.
[134:05] Maybe. (soft music)
[134:09] (soft music) (soft music)
[134:12] (groans) Anyway, do a screen, share in bed.
[134:22] Share in bed. (upbeat music)
[134:25] Oh, oh. So, where is it?
[134:54] Are you in bed this time? (upbeat music)
[135:09] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[135:14] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[135:20] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[135:28] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[135:38] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[135:48] Hmm. (upbeat music)
[135:53] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[136:02] (upbeat music) Uh, who's on the computer?
[136:12] Okay, this is, this is what happens.
[136:16] And I guess this still helps out enough that I can, you know, do my own thing.
[136:24] It's just, I'm really bad at not getting just super distracted
[136:31] and wanting to finish this one thing and then continue. So, we will work on doing that now.
[136:39] 'Cause I think with the chat, I can set that up and we can try setting it back and forth.
[136:45] And then maybe I'll even try the stream itself. Oh, we can add a calendar too.
[136:55] Or not a calendar, a countdown. Countdown.
[136:58] Oh, that's why it wasn't. Y'all, I figured out why my other screen wasn't moving
[137:06] was because it was full screen. That helps.
[137:09] That helps. Yeah.
[137:11] That helps. (upbeat music)
[137:15] All right. So, I think I have Ping well enough.
[137:26] So, I'm actually going to change this to duplicate this. And the duplicate is, I'm gonna say,
[137:38] guest and Jen's screen share. Because it's not working to show theirs.
[137:48] But then for just Jen, I'm gonna be deleting this one, which is guest one.
[138:01] Let's delete it. Let's delete that, please.
[138:07] No. Delete it.
[138:09] I think, 'cause this one has both. This one does not have both.
[138:17] Okay. We're doing good.
[138:19] We're doing good. So, I can move this down.
[138:23] I guess they're gonna seem a little different. That's fine.
[138:27] 'Cause then I can just do this. I'm gonna get the chat bigger.
[138:37] (upbeat music) Make it easier to read.
[138:40] And then eventually I'll get the captions underneath. All right.
[138:45] So, and then we are going to duplicate this one. Duplicate.
[138:52] And then we're gonna say, just Jen. There's no screen share.
[139:00] What? (upbeat music)
[139:06] Maybe it's not already in use. You see it on your screens?
[139:13] Whatever. Okay, just Jen with chat.
[139:18] We'll call it that. Jen with chat.
[139:25] Okay. That means I can edit this.
[139:34] Screen share needs to change. Yes, yes, I am sure.
[139:39] I need to make my face big. (upbeat music)
[139:44] And then we can do option. What?
[139:57] Okay. So, those ones are done.
[140:01] And up next, we can figure out a countdown.
[140:09] (upbeat music) Hmm, hmm.
[140:16] 'Cause, let's try this. Countdown, countdown video.
[140:28] (upbeat music) And I can do it from the browser.
[140:38] You can also choose a media source. See, I guess I will go create one.
[140:46] Which y'all, I don't know if you knew this, but Canva can do a lot of this.
[140:57] (upbeat music) It's pretty sweet.
[141:08] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[141:13] (upbeat music) I don't know if it can do like a five minute countdown
[141:46] or anything, that's what I want to do, but it doesn't mean it can.
[141:52] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[141:57] As y'all can probably see, my computer is struggling and I'm doing too much to it.
[142:26] Probably because it's too hot in here. (upbeat music)
[142:32] ♪ And we can do ♪ (upbeat music)
[142:44] (upbeat music) Lots of, an hour countdown, that's nice.
[143:03] (upbeat music) Videos.
[143:11] (upbeat music) Let me make this bigger.
[143:17] So I'm just looking at, so this one's a five minute countdown.
[143:20] Oh, I like this one. (upbeat music)
[143:24] I like that it also shows like what is, you know, the timeframe next to it.
[143:38] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[143:43] And let's see, I'm gonna quit OBS for now because I'm not using it and my computer is freezing.
[143:58] (upbeat music) Yay, it seemed to like that I'm not using OBS
[144:05] and StreamYard at the same minute and probably ping. Probably doesn't like that I'm also using ping.
[144:11] Okay, hold on, yes, yes, leave, leave everything. It'll be okay.
[144:17] (upbeat music) Sweet, okay, it did like that more, yay.
[144:23] So I'm digging this five minute one and I saw a 30 minute one, which are just nice
[144:30] when you are going to stream for a long time. Like what if you wanna take lunch or something?
[144:37] And then, let's see if there's any others that we want. I don't think so, I think these are pretty dope.
[144:50] I will be putting in this. (upbeat music)
[144:58] Yay, it is, okay. I'm gonna do this one.
[145:11] (upbeat music) Let me see if I can pick it, just be the countdown.
[145:29] Might look really dumb, I have no idea. Just trying it out.
[145:33] (upbeat music) (humming)
[145:39] I like if I were to do this, I need to remove that, but I don't think that looks bad.
[145:47] What do y'all think? I think it matches brandy enough.
[145:55] I can do just the graphic by itself, which blank background is what it's called,
[146:03] which would make sense. If I do that, though.
[146:08] (upbeat music) Replace background, please.
[146:12] (upbeat music) Would you just replace the background, please?
[146:20] Why are you not doing that? (upbeat music)
[146:24] Whatever. Send back.
[146:35] Send. Let's see.
[146:40] I kinda like it like that more. You can change the minutes?
[146:56] Oh, not more than five, though. I was gonna get really excited about that, but nevermind.
[147:02] So, let's do the same thing down here for the 30. (upbeat music)
[147:09] (humming) I mean, I feel like they're gonna work.
[147:29] They're not the coolest things ever, but I also, they kinda bug me, though.
[147:35] (upbeat music) I feel like it's weird that it doesn't match the branding.
[147:50] (upbeat music) (humming)
[147:55] I never really wanted, oh, is this actually a countdown? No, you are a fake countdown.
[148:07] I'm pretty sure if I had something, I wonder if Stream Elements has something like that.
[148:16] Stream Elements. Ryan got me looking into Stream Elements,
[148:25] and I'm like, dude, this is cool. Let's go to the dashboard.
[148:28] 'Cause they do have things that, oh, yeah, you guys can see my stats.
[148:36] I'm pretty excited. In January, I've gotten 39 followers so far.
[148:41] So, hit 200 this month. Very excited about that.
[148:45] And it's all about consistency. Consistency, consistency.
[148:50] Overlays. (upbeat music)
[148:53] I almost think this is not gonna have a timer because it's an overlay, not a video.
[148:58] Boom. (upbeat music)
[149:03] I just wanna look at templates. My mic is in the way.
[149:06] (upbeat music) Okay, fine.
[149:10] (upbeat music) Consistency, no.
[149:21] (upbeat music) Gotta add the free.
[149:48] Gotta add the free. I don't know if it's actually gonna exist,
[149:52] but this one actually works. (upbeat music)
[149:59] Interesting. Free.
[150:03] See if it's added. (upbeat music)
[150:07] File type. Yeah, this does not have video.
[150:21] That's annoying. Assets free.
[150:26] (upbeat music) Whatever, we'll get there.
[150:34] We will get there. (upbeat music)
[150:46] You know what? I'm gonna take this as a pause
[150:48] 'cause I'm starting to get hungry and this is gonna take a lot of work,
[150:53] but I appreciate all of you coming to hang out. It's been fun.
[150:58] It's been rad. And I'm gonna go do the rest of my day.
[151:04] So enjoy your Monday. I appreciate you coming to hang out.
[151:09] Make sure you subscribe or follow or do all of the above and come hang out on Twitter.
[151:16] And I stream like four days a week, three to four days a week.
[151:20] This week I'll be at View Nation, but you know, it'll be cool.
[151:25] All right, bye. (upbeat music)
[151:29] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[151:34] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[151:39] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[151:45] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
