[04:14] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[04:35] (upbeat music) Ooh, it hid it by itself.
[05:02] It's the first time using it. So of course I got like excited that it works.
[05:06] Yay. And hello, hello, beautiful humans.
[05:09] Welcome to Teach Gen Tech. Well, we, well, while we apparently can't talk,
[05:16] but while we learn together and diminish the barriers to get into tech.
[05:23] Chat GPT and I worked on that earlier this week. I'm very glad that we have a tagline now.
[05:28] Pretty cool. And today we are hanging out with Erin.
[05:33] Erin, who are you and what do you do and what are you hanging out with?
[05:36] And how are we friends? All of the questions.
[05:38] All of the questions, all of the above. Everything is awesome and I am fine.
[05:43] The end. But TLDR, I'm Erin McHale Staples.
[05:49] I am a dev rel, dev advocate, community, technical community building open source person.
[05:55] One of those people who fit in all of the above titles most recently in the open source machine learning space
[06:01] and doing some fun stuff, but I'm on the quest for the next adventure.
[06:05] So that's a really long way of saying hire me, but also I'm a full-time standup comedian now.
[06:11] Now, I didn't tell you this, but can you tell us a joke on the spot now?
[06:20] Oh, that's like the thing that everybody says to do. I can tell you a joke.
[06:25] Oh yes, tell me a joke and I'll tell you a joke. Okay, what's the difference between a horny toad
[06:31] and a regular toad? Horny?
[06:35] One goes ribbit, ribbit, one goes rubbit, rubbit. I love that, that was great.
[06:43] Guess who taught me that one though? Who?
[06:46] My partner's grandma. That makes it even better, even better.
[06:57] Yeah, let's see, we'll tell you a little joke. So been married three years and you're at the point
[07:06] and you're wondering if your marriage is gonna get stale. I'm gonna take a page out of the very hit movie,
[07:13] Human Centipede, and in that you have to be careful what happens when you go from mouth to ass.
[07:22] (both laughing) Ew, and funny.
[07:31] I like how we're both in the gutter with the dirty sex jokes today.
[07:36] Yes, yes, apparently we're like, you know, not gonna be normal, we'll just like go with dirty jokes.
[07:46] It's good, it's good. Yeah, why would we wanna do that
[07:51] when we can just not, you know? 'Cause it makes Tech Tuesday way better.
[07:57] And talking about Tech Tuesday, we're kind of like taking a break from tech,
[08:02] but not 'cause we're doing all the boring shit behind the scenes that we have to do
[08:07] because I have a giant to-do list and my brain was very stuck on the giant to-do list
[08:16] compared to actually getting anything done, like being able to learn.
[08:23] I don't know if that happens to anybody else, but I was like, I have this deadline.
[08:27] I gotta get it done. Yeah, yeah, and that's how we got here.
[08:32] So thank you. And you had fancy-dancy paper
[08:36] that you were gonna write down our to-do list. Yes, I was gonna write down this very fancy list.
[08:42] Also, I have a dumb question. Is it just me or am I in the wrong chat window?
[08:46] I can see some things. I see Exquia, am I on the right stream?
[08:50] Am I on the right stream? Am I on the right stream?
[08:53] I'm looking for are the comments. I can see them.
[08:59] I can see them in the Twitch. Okay, maybe it's just me.
[09:02] Oh, weird, I can't see them in the Twitch ones. Wow, maybe it's just me being special today.
[09:08] Again, we're just gonna ignore all that good stuff. Well, you know what, we'll just do this.
[09:15] Here's the link and everybody, please go tell their friends
[09:19] and link them to come hang out with us. We're gonna get some shit done.
[09:25] Yeah, and we wanna hang out with people while we do it because it'll be much more amusing.
[09:29] So tell them to go to the Twitch channel and come hang out. So, yeah. You could retell them.
[09:40] Retell them. Yeah, I did.
[09:42] I did post this in the Discord. So come hang out and don't be a stranger
[09:47] and it'll be really fun. And that's what we're doing.
[09:50] But yeah, we were gonna write down a list of shit that we were gonna get done.
[09:54] I have a really cool notepad that says, but first antidepressants because same, same.
[10:01] It's actually probably first Adderall, but that's more accurate in my world
[10:07] 'cause otherwise we don't get anything. But first up on my list is I need to,
[10:13] there's some broken links on my website. So fix broken links on website.
[10:20] And then send email, I've been procrastinating. That's another one.
[10:25] - Ooh, yeah. - I've been, it's procrasturbating, procrasturbating.
[10:33] I'm putting this on the notepad in official. So if you see that, if you wanna check that out,
[10:42] that is legit what I wrote on box two of things you're gonna do.
[10:47] - Very on theme for our stream today. I'm loving it.
[10:51] - Very on theme. The other one is some broken links.
[10:57] Send the email, I've been procrastinating. I'm also going to, because I'm looking for a job,
[11:04] this is when you put the (indistinct) I need to apply to a job.
[11:10] So there's two jobs that I haven't finished the application for because y'all, this is the hard part.
[11:16] So send complete. One is someone forwarded me the link
[11:21] to a job opening at Google. So it's a Google job.
[11:26] - Yay, that would be a yay. - That'd be, I'm kind of terrified to be honest.
[11:32] I like just never thought I was that type of person to be doing that.
[11:36] And then one is I need to look up the name of the company. Someone sent it to me.
[11:40] - Yo, mention all the roles you're going after. - Okay, so I just got rejected from a role
[11:47] literally five minutes before the stream. So guess I'm not going there, fine.
[11:51] Let me go up my list, which is also in another, we talked about notebooks, type of roles.
[11:56] I am looking for roles in like developer advocacy, developer experience engineer, developer relations,
[12:08] community, open source, that type of area. Education programs is like another part
[12:15] that I've done stuff in. But I have, again, in this other notebook,
[12:19] a list of all the companies I've applied to. And yes, all I see roles, X yet.
[12:25] So yeah, all I see is where I'd like to be, like a senior level I see.
[12:33] That's where I'd like to be, is in that senior level role. But I'm happy to say it. - All the roles you mentioned,
[12:39] yeah, are definitely more I see type roles. And for those, I'm pretty sure everybody here
[12:45] probably knows it, but when I first started talking with people, they said, I see, and I'm like, I see what?
[12:52] What do you see? - I see what, yeah, no. What do you see?
[12:56] - Individual contributor, because that is the fun part of tech is all of the lingo.
[13:03] There's so much of it. - I'm just like, it's so hard, so.
[13:07] - How many notebooks are you using right now? - This is my stack.
[13:11] - Nice. I got this. - The top one is my iPad.
[13:19] So yeah, and then I have, this is a book. - I can't do the digital notes.
[13:27] - Oh, and I see individual, I guess like, individual contributor to the code base.
[13:31] So when I think of individual contributor, I think of like someone who doesn't manage people.
[13:36] - Yeah. - That's like, yeah. Like that's like the term that I think is like,
[13:41] I'm not managing people, I'm not a people manager, but yeah, that makes sense, yeah.
[13:48] But I could see that. This is a book on attention.
[13:51] I started reading it and then I lost attention. There's a joke there.
[13:56] - Oh, please ask, please ask ChatGPT about it. So we actually know, it's not gonna be, you know,
[14:04] a hundred percent accurate, but we could see what the- - Yeah, ask the ChatGPT then.
[14:09] - Yeah. - Oh, do you like your Remarkable?
[14:11] 'Cause I actually have looked at a Remarkable. - I, you're asking them, but I'm,
[14:17] I use your Remarkable and I hated it with a passion. - Really? Okay.
[14:21] I like to feel like a pen and paper. That's like my thing.
[14:24] - So my iPad has a cover that feels like paper and wherever I just threw it, I have a pen.
[14:34] It's literally pen and paper. Well, it feels like pen and paper.
[14:39] - I have a notebook that says, it has my stickers on it. So it says, "Hard work leads talent."
[14:48] And then it has a Python notebook that says, "Final, final, untitled," which is great.
[14:54] And then I have this one that has my political stickers on the back.
[15:01] So, and sorry, I got brain weasels and open sources. So, yeah, it has all my other stuff on it.
[15:09] And then I have this sticker that I got this weekend at an art market, which I think is very on brand,
[15:15] but I haven't decided where I'm putting it 'cause that's a commitment, man.
[15:19] - I feel like that one's even big enough to put on a car. - Yeah.
[15:24] - But that's a big commitment. That's not really a thing.
[15:27] - I don't have a car. So it's like, also I have a tinned fish girl.
[15:32] I also got there 'cause I love sardines. But anywho.
[15:38] - Spam. - Yeah.
[15:42] - I keep walking by it in the store and I've never had it. And I don't know how, I should look how you cook it
[15:50] 'cause I've-- - I've had like a Spam Mubi Subi.
[15:54] - A what, a Mubi? - It's like a Hawaiian dish.
[15:58] It's like a Hawaiian, it's like fried Spam and then rice and seaweed on it.
[16:03] - Oh, that sounds delicious. - It's pretty good, pretty good.
[16:06] - Okay, okay. Is there anything else you need to add to your to-do list?
[16:12] - So Google job app, figure out what this other company's job app.
[16:16] - Oh, and then I need to reach out to, I have a comedy show.
[16:24] If you're listening and you're in the New York area, hit me up.
[16:26] - Do it. - Partnerships for my comedy show.
[16:31] Oh, and then I have to post about my open mic tonight. - And you don't have to live there to know connections there
[16:40] to connect with. - Yeah.
[16:44] If you know people in the New York area or if you know people that are hiring remote people,
[16:48] hit me up. I like to think that I'm pretty cool.
[16:51] - Dope. - Hey Jen, what are you gonna get done in this next hour?
[16:56] And then we decided we were gonna dance every time that we get something done, right?
[17:00] - Yes, every time we get something done, we're gonna dance.
[17:03] And I am, this is a big reason why I like the iPad is 'cause this thing looks like paper,
[17:13] but then I can do this, do, do, do. I need to do my talk deck for TypeScript Congress, maybe.
[17:22] It's a really long, long, long to do. And then what else do I need to do?
[17:42] I need to figure out my API calls. Technically API sorting.
[17:51] Because there is, there's words and things. It says words.
[18:02] And my mentor in learning all of this keeps giving me hints that I'm like,
[18:07] dude, it's not clicking. And I'm also not able to always like work on it very long.
[18:11] So I keep like forgetting to go back to it. It doesn't help.
[18:16] And then I also need to work on, what is that called?
[18:25] Oh, production notes for, notes for Teach Gen Tech.
[18:40] And there's a thing I need to do. Oh, guest organization and figure out the podcast stuff.
[18:57] And figure out the podcast stuff. Shit, you don't want to talk about.
[19:14] 'Cause it needs to be relaunched and it's not going to get there
[19:22] if I don't come up with strategy for it. There is my to-do list.
[19:25] Yay. Woo.
[19:28] I have a podcast called Shit You Don't Want to Talk About. It's fun.
[19:33] - It's pretty cool. It's pretty cool.
[19:36] - I don't, y'all this is how long it's been since I've looked at it is I'm like,
[19:41] I don't even know if a link tree is still alive. Oh, it is.
[19:50] It has some fun colors. So go and enjoy that link tree and see.
[19:58] We'll do it this way. We'll go.
[20:05] Like, look at that. That is some rough colors.
[20:10] - There's some colors in that. - Yeah, but I think if it's still linked.
[20:16] Oh, it does. It shows you all of the episodes,
[20:21] but you can go listen to them on other things, which I think is a cool feature.
[20:26] And yeah, I don't know if the website still works. Oh, hey, it's the old website
[20:31] that I'm working on rebuilding. And, oh, it does show all the episodes.
[20:37] When did this one? Oh God.
[20:41] It's been eight months since I've come out with an episode. It's cool.
[20:45] - I think you've been employed for eight months though. So that's.
[20:47] - That's true. - That makes sense.
[20:51] But I was also like really struggling with launching Teach Gen Tech,
[20:59] because I'm like, how do you keep up with a live stream and the podcast?
[21:05] And then I was like, that's, then I got a job and keeping up with the live stream.
[21:13] I'm learning. It'll get there.
[21:16] It'll be good. - Yeah.
[21:17] I did the same thing where I was like, I was being so good at writing on my blog
[21:20] and then I got a job. - It's crazy how that happens.
[21:25] - And now I'm like, shit, I gotta do this again.
[21:32] So yeah, that's where I'm at. - I love your idea.
[21:43] How do, I hate trying to say people's like names. That's really bad.
[21:49] I'm just really bad at names, but Xgit, Xgit, XG, X cool friend.
[21:55] I like your idea about the live stream, the podcast, but it's very sensitive topics that live streaming
[22:08] while somebody is explaining a really tough time or a really tough conversation
[22:19] is gonna put more pressure on someone. So that's why a big reason that I don't live stream them.
[22:24] Although I have figured out that I could record them in StreamYard and save part of the process
[22:32] because then it would have this lovely background without having to worry about it and record the video.
[22:38] And then I can export it as audio. So might save some processes there.
[22:44] And Erin, do you want to share your screen while you're working or I can share my screen?
[22:53] - Yeah, I can share my screen. I'm just doing some broken links.
[22:55] You can fix in some links on my. - Sweet.
[22:59] - You guys can see the hell, which is the back end of my ghost site and what I'm doing.
[23:04] - Can you guys see that okay? Or do we need to ask?
[23:08] - I can zoom. - Zoom, zoom, zoom.
[23:10] I've zoomed in in the wrong tab. - Oh, I keep doing that too.
[23:15] - So yeah, I need to go to this post. I need to change my menu.
[23:20] So I'm just gonna fix some broken links. But if you want to turn on some jams
[23:23] or if anybody has any cool things they want to say. - Yeah, tell us all the cool things.
[23:29] What are you guys up to? Y'all doing anything fun?
[23:33] I will say that's like one of the hardest terms to get used to is not saying guys.
[23:44] Because it's so. - Oh, that's something that I really will admit
[23:48] I struggle with. - Is really hard because I do like that there's,
[23:54] terminology is becoming a lot more, you know, open.
[24:00] And I'm like, guys is the one I get stuck on. So I say y'all a lot too.
[24:06] Yes, what are y'all working on? 'Cause our to-do list.
[24:12] Erin, what do you think? If they get something done on their to-do list,
[24:15] will we do a little dance? - Oh, of course, of course.
[24:18] We will also dance if we do that. So please dance, stream, holler, what's up?
[24:25] I'm working on this page right here. And one thing that would be really helpful
[24:29] if you're listening in is yeah, tell me some feedback that you'd want to see on this page.
[24:34] This is my for hire page. It's, I realized I shared the wrong window.
[24:39] So I shared it so it doesn't change tatties. But I'm actually gonna do some quick window swapping,
[24:45] window hot swapping here. You guys can see the full Erin brain,
[24:51] which is, this is a scary, scary thought. But I even have, do you know Mia Moore?
[25:05] - Oh, I do know. - They are at Komunda,
[25:09] but they do this little Pomo farm thing. And it's really great.
[25:13] And so I'm just gonna share my full desktop so you can see what my desktop looks like.
[25:21] Also, my freaking husband has the hummus. We share an office, but he has the--
[25:31] - Yes, the hummus Slack. - The hummus sound on Slack.
[25:34] And it just went off and I was like, "What is this?"
[25:36] And I can hear it through my headphones. But yeah, I would really appreciate
[25:41] if anybody has any feedback on that page, especially for you folks who are doing that.
[25:47] That'd be really helpful. - Trying to figure out feature flags
[25:52] and A/B testing framework for work without reinventing the wheel.
[25:57] Dude, that is rough. Trying to do stuff without reinventing the wheel
[26:02] when you're like, "Yo, this isn't working," is rough.
[26:07] That is definitely rough. - Truly.
[26:12] - Can we loop tracks? Maybe it will do all the tracks.
[26:19] I hope so. Y'all, we're gonna find out if it does all the tracks or...
[26:30] (upbeat music) I don't know how loud I need it.
[26:39] (upbeat music) I am gonna go see if I can get us more music first, though.
[27:09] My support, I'm working on my updating this page that has a few typos and broken links on it.
[27:14] (upbeat music) - Ooh, I like what X said.
[27:24] A lot of the frameworks they found for feature flags are also questionable for their scale.
[27:32] (upbeat music) Dude, yes.
[27:36] (upbeat music) Ooh.
[27:43] (upbeat music) Nice.
[27:58] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[28:03] Okay. (upbeat music)
[28:18] It's Lerner. Hi, Lerner.
[28:28] Look, we moved the time of the stream. Hey.
[28:31] (upbeat music) I think I should find longer songs.
[28:45] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[28:50] I'm completely looking off screen in case anybody's curious.
[29:08] I'm checking, trying to like, with a bunch of music on,
[29:13] using Wave Video to find a track for us. What up, Matt?
[29:18] (upbeat music) Hi, Matty.
[29:22] (upbeat music) I said Matt by like looking fast and it's totally...
[29:31] (upbeat music) That's funny.
[29:33] (upbeat music) Yeah, it's also an Aaron.
[29:42] It's a wild Aaron. Yeah, it's a wild Aaron.
[29:47] I appeared. I've been on Matty's stream last.
[29:48] Actually, Matty's the person who taught me about Guest Star. So, Matty, we can get Guest Star working with Stream Yarn.
[29:56] It has to be with OBS. And I feel very lazy.
[30:02] I don't wanna figure that out right before stream. Okay.
[30:09] I wonder if this will actually export. (upbeat music)
[30:14] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[30:19] (upbeat music) We are doing our to-do lists at the moment.
[30:51] We both wrote out our to-do lists and... It's right here.
[30:56] Yeah, mine is on my iPad. And what's on your to-do list, Aaron?
[31:04] You get to go first. My to-do list is currently,
[31:08] I am fixing broken links on my website. And then I had a recruiter that I used to work with
[31:13] who gave me some feedback on my For Hire page. So, it's this page right here.
[31:18] So, I am making those updates on the website. And then I'm going to send an email
[31:27] that I've been procrastinating. I have two job apps to do.
[31:31] And then I have to reach out to some partnerships for my comedy show that I host.
[31:36] And then I have to post about my comedy open mic. It's tonight.
[31:40] So, if you're in the Brooklyn area, or in your New York City,
[31:43] and you want to see some comedy stuff, hit me up. But yeah.
[31:46] And Learner, yeah, ML with human feedback. That's my jam.
[31:51] Yes, yes. And I am working on,
[31:58] well, currently I'm working on seeing if I can use what I used to create the countdown video
[32:04] to create us a soundtrack. So, we don't have to listen to the same song and repeat.
[32:10] And, but my to-do list today is to actually do my deck on TypeScript Congress,
[32:17] 'cause I have that talk coming up and I need to get my deck done
[32:21] and record it for Speaker's Corner, 'cause it like fell through the cracks.
[32:28] So, that's what I'm doing. It's very, very exciting.
[32:33] - Yeah, it's gonna be super exciting. Let's see, I need to find my.
[32:44] - I'm gonna play the next song, because it didn't play for us,
[32:51] even though it's on loop. Is it not on loop?
[32:53] Oh, maybe I didn't turn it on loop. Let's try this next one.
[32:56] I feel like that one was really loud, so. And I saw that I also get to create more of a to-do list
[33:05] with a more to prep for next week and learn on that. I need to add that to my to-do list actually.
[33:17] Maddie, what are you up to? - Yeah, what are you guys working on?
[33:36] - And Maddie, just as like a random thing, when are you gonna be on the screen?
[33:48] Like, I feel like, Maddie, you could be on the stream about something
[33:51] and it would be really fun. (upbeat music)
[33:55] - Aaron, do you, I know you streamed one of your comedy shows,
[34:22] um, do you have the link to that? And do you ever stream other ones?
[34:28] - Oh, um, yeah, we did one that is streamed. I can send you a reel or you can follow me on TikTok,
[34:37] which does get the most recent snippets of it. I'm on TikTok @AaronMcHale_.
[34:43] We also are potentially, this is like spoiler alert audience,
[34:52] potentially, uh, so I run an AI comedy show called Comedy Bites.
[34:56] We do some pretty cool stuff, but one of the cool things that we do
[35:00] is we are going to be potentially taking our show on the road.
[35:04] - Which would be awesome. - Yeah, but if you go @AaronMcHale_ on TikTok,
[35:11] I don't really understand how to link it and I need to find my TikTok.
[35:14] That is me on TikTok. I just posted a TikTok literally,
[35:17] like probably, um, an hour ago.
[35:22] That's it, yeah. So it's about yeeting tech bros to Mars.
[35:28] So, but yeah, it's a, I build robots for comedy. - No, Maddie, I didn't get laid off.
[35:38] I, um, Aaron's looking for a job and I'm working on doing everything else
[35:43] that I'm supposed to be doing. - I also love that it centered late.
[35:48] - But we still need to have you on the show. Like,
[35:53] I need a, that is on my to-do list is organizing guests and stuff like that.
[36:00] So maybe, oh, no.
[36:05] I mean, that's a good call. - Oh yeah, this is my, this is my,
[36:09] this is my screen, Maddie. So.
[36:12] - Maybe I should put a banner of like Aaron's screen. So that way.
[36:16] - Aaron's screen, just link to my for hire page and be like, hire me, please.
[36:19] - Let's see. Add banner.
[36:23] - Wait, I got the link of the page that I'm linking on. Here you go.
[36:30] There's the page. - Screen sharing is two words.
[36:35] Aaron is screen sharing.
[36:39] I don't know. (upbeat music)
[36:45] - I wish that it like would show us this, but without taking away our names.
[36:56] - Oh yeah, weird. - Yes, go hire Aaron.
[37:05] See, there we go. Oh, there we go.
[37:08] Maybe I'll just leave this comment up while you're doing it.
[37:12] I mean, it still doesn't show our names and stuff, but. Lerner, this is a weird question,
[37:21] but like if you have good enough internet, I feel like. - Yeah.
[37:28] - You should be able to. Do you have good enough internet, Lerner?
[37:33] Plus I feel like you're the OG of like all of these streams that like you have to start going on them.
[37:40] (upbeat music) - It's for sure.
[38:10] I just realized I don't follow you. How do I not follow you back on Twitch?
[38:15] That's silly. Let's do this.
[38:19] This is how often I don't do stuff anymore, apparently. - Y'all, okay.
[38:32] Can I like? If you don't laugh, you cry, truly.
[38:38] That is a true story. But you have to laugh.
[38:43] And then someone asked if I made up that joke for my standup set and I had to tell them, no,
[38:49] that's 100% what happened to me is I got laid off by being added to a Slack channel titled "Goodbye."
[38:57] Yeah, it's really sad. But anywho.
[39:04] - Ooh, Maddie, I love that idea. Let's do that.
[39:09] 'Cause on my list that I'm going to add is like find a time on Wednesdays to stream
[39:13] that doesn't overlap other people's streams. 'Cause I know Jen's starting a stream on Wednesday.
[39:18] - Yeah, I'm sorry, but mine's every other Wednesday. And I mean, mine's for work though, like.
[39:25] - Yeah, so like, I still wanna like. Impossible, I know it's impossible.
[39:31] I just feel like Wednesday is a good. - I moved this stream an hour early
[39:36] because it was overlapping Josh's stream. But Josh is a guest on my show once a month.
[39:41] So I was like, I feel like that would be good to do that. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[39:47] - But my stream is going to be every other Wednesday from like seven to nine Pacific.
[39:58] So that's 10 to 12 Eastern. (upbeat music)
[40:04] And then once I get that one going, the long-term is to get,
[40:13] I don't know, it's things and stuff. I'm looking, I'm looking, honestly.
[40:22] I do have it written down somewhere, just a sec. Wait, let me find the tweet about it.
[40:27] 'Cause that will, if you guys could retweet and we're changing my to-do list.
[40:36] I do need to tweet this for today. And also, let's see, okay.
[40:41] Adding to my to-do list. And then I actually get to get up and dance,
[40:57] is post about Ivan stream tomorrow or tomorrow. I am starting the Ivan stream,
[41:23] but it's like a soft launch before, so I can figure out like the flow of it
[41:27] before we do our official, official like hype launch next week or in a month.
[41:33] Here we go. (upbeat music)
[41:53] It's, yeah, it's 2 p.m. UTC. (upbeat music)
[42:06] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[42:11] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[42:16] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[42:46] Also, learner, you can do a digital background. That's an option.
[42:51] I think I can even do it in StreamYard. I don't know, let's find out.
[42:57] I got bricks. Oh, look, I got a fancy house.
[43:05] I'm in a bougie house. There's the blur.
[43:11] The blur's kind of cool. We'll leave the blur on, it's fun.
[43:16] I don't know what else to say. Where did I put this?
[43:27] Yeah. (upbeat music)
[43:35] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[43:46] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[44:05] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[44:19] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[44:31] - Oh, yes, Ryan, that is my Twitter. - Oh, yes, thank you, Ryan.
[44:49] And hi, Ryan. And currently we're using StreamYard stuff
[44:53] because I haven't uploaded new music to it.
[45:00] And I will say I'm lazy about switching to OBS because I'm like, "I don't wanna."
[45:09] But it's a lot of work, but I mean, it's good. But let's, StreamYard just loops the same one.
[45:16] Upload a different ones. Yes, go look at the comedy reel.
[45:30] - It's an older comedy reel. It's weird to be like, "It's an older comedy reel."
[45:35] But yeah. Wow, wow.
[45:43] Maddie with the snark. It's okay, Maddie, I did download my OBS templates.
[45:48] So points for me, I just didn't install them yet. - So I actually have my,
[45:57] I have them set up. So I should say that.
[46:00] I do actually have OBS set up. It's just, I don't know, I don't like using it.
[46:06] I don't like the fact that whenever I go to record my like offline videos,
[46:12] that I could accidentally hit go live instead of record. Ooh.
[46:24] - Ooh. - Ooh, ooh, I like these.
[46:35] I need to find, I know I have a... - Where are these templates that we can check out, Maddie?
[46:50] (gentle music) Ooh, that's a good call out, Maddie.
[47:05] And I know it's something just I need to get used to, which I probably will get there.
[47:11] It's also, now that I'm starting the Ivan one, it's just gonna be easy to use this tool.
[47:17] And use the same platform, like type of platform. I need a different emoji.
[47:29] Oh, there we go, that's gonna be my talk giver. I don't know why.
[47:44] Does this take forever for anybody else? Like I am just like snailing getting things done today.
[47:52] But hey, that's okay. I get to hang out with everybody.
[47:55] - Yeah, I've gotten some stuff done. - That's good.
[48:02] - I'm like over here updating some broken, some links. Blah, blah, blah.
[48:08] (gentle music) - Maddie, you finished your day two hours ago.
[48:32] Are you just like chilling? It's chill time.
[48:35] - Just chill time, just hanging out with Jen and Erin. - Chill time?
[48:39] - Post. And post.
[49:01] - Post. Sandwiches and text streamers, yes.
[49:14] - What type of sandwiches are you eating, Maddie? (gentle music)
[49:21] (gentle music) - Well, we were talking about spam earlier.
[49:51] So you're having ham instead of spam. I was curious if spam was any good.
[49:58] - I'm curious 'cause for those of you who are not in the US, oh look, my Pomo farm says
[50:10] I get to farm some cute little things. So this is how cute it is.
[50:14] It's like a little game and then you get a break and it says, "Erin, do some things."
[50:21] But of course it's now gonna freeze on me. And I'm in a water.
[50:24] - Can I go any bigger? - Yeah, my...
[50:28] Full screen. Oh, it's not gonna full screen it
[50:37] 'cause it's on and over again. - No, I can see it.
[50:39] We can, no, we can see it. - Oh, take it back.
[50:46] - Madia, it's called severe ADHD. Severe, that's what it's called.
[50:54] - Why is my hammer... - This is how I came to find my life.
[50:58] So yeah, and then you get this little cute guy. I don't know if I killed my flowers.
[51:02] I don't think I have anything to sell, but I'm gonna buy some more plants here.
[51:06] I have 25 peas. I'm gonna buy this one, some carrots and some mushroom.
[51:14] Oh, I don't have enough money for a mushroom. I guess I'm gonna buy some more carrots.
[51:19] And then I'm gonna plant them. I'm gonna plant them.
[51:24] Wow, it's kind of as buggy full screen. This is the best like $3.99 I've played on the Steam store.
[51:31] Also, so one of the things that I do because my brain does not like on the...
[51:38] To kind of on the shit you should talk about, we should talk about the name Jen.
[51:43] It's like, Jen knows this, like I have ADHD, but like I don't do well when routines are broken.
[51:49] And so one of the things that I struggle with is like, I get like when I don't have enough strategy stuff
[51:56] to do during the day, like my brain is like at night going, oh my goodness, you didn't do anything.
[51:59] Like, what are you doing with your life? And so it just doesn't turn off.
[52:03] So I've been trying to play like at night to wind down. I've been playing really heavy strategy games.
[52:06] So if anybody has wants to play some cool strategy games with me, hit me up.
[52:10] Or like, that's why I've been like really diving into like, Maddie and I streamed together
[52:15] and worked on some database stuff. And like, I was like brushing up on some people skills.
[52:18] And also Maddie, by the way, Megan and I are BFFs now. - It's Wesley.
[52:23] - Yeah, Wesley is here. What's up?
[52:27] - Wesley, I'm so sad I didn't get a picture with you. - It's fine, Wesley left me at AWS and it's fine.
[52:37] That's, it's okay, I'm kidding. Wesley, I love you.
[52:40] And we will always have scooters and fun together. Wesley was the first person I met in DevRel
[52:45] and has helped like gearing, helping me understand the processes of my life.
[52:53] We'll go with that. And I was so excited.
[52:56] I met him in person at AWS summit and then we didn't get a selfie.
[53:01] He left like five minutes before I went to look for him for a selfie.
[53:04] I was like, damn it. Wesley, if you don't know, no, it's okay.
[53:10] 'Cause like Wesley, it's great. 'Cause like, I actually went to Wesley this year
[53:13] a lot 'cause I was like, hey, I've been in, I'm in this weird situation at work
[53:16] and I don't know how to handle it. Please help.
[53:18] You know how to help. And it was like the best advice ever.
[53:20] And like, yeah. And actually when I was laid off,
[53:23] Wesley was the person that like made me feel like it was all gonna be okay.
[53:26] Like Wesley texted me and was like, you're right, Erin. And I was like, it's okay.
[53:30] I'm like, thanks, Wesley, thanks. So, but we're on a break time
[53:35] because the Pomodoro farm says we can be on a break. It says break time.
[53:39] So it is okay. Don't worry about derailing it.
[53:42] It's fine. Anywho, if you don't know Wesley and you're in this chat,
[53:48] just know that Wesley's a shit. - And you should go follow Wesley on LinkedIn
[53:54] and Mastodon and Pollywork. Safe.
[54:02] We are awesome. - Thanks.
[54:08] Oh, and as a, because I'm not saying enough, I feel like I need to say it more,
[54:14] but in case I don't say it enough, please hit the follow button on Twitch while you're here.
[54:19] As the Twitch followers grow, we will be able to get more sponsorships
[54:25] to help teach gen tech, but also shit you don't want to talk about.
[54:30] Yay. Yay.
[54:33] Thank you, Wesley. I need to like with a spiel to say that like properly.
[54:39] Like, yeah. - I just need to get back on like streaming regularly again.
[54:42] That's step one. - Yes.
[54:45] Yes, you do. - Step one.
[54:47] - Darko yelled at me about, okay, Darko didn't really yell at me,
[54:49] but Darko was like, you have to stream on a regular cadence,
[54:52] even when you're traveling. So I guess I need to set that up too.
[54:58] Damn it. Hey, I did get one thing done.
[55:02] Y'all, I got one thing done. I get to dance.
[55:04] I get to dance. This is not dance music though.
[55:07] - Just change the music for dance music. - I don't know if this one's dance music.
[55:15] - Well, I have to go. Look, focus time.
[55:21] My little thing's here. - Let's go to our dance music for now.
[55:33] Next time we do this, Erin, we should probably like play better dance music.
[55:37] If anybody knows dance music that you can add on StreamYard, please let me know.
[55:46] And yes, Wesley, we will. It's going to be amazing.
[56:00] - We'll see how long we can listen to this on repeat before we get annoyed with it.
[56:05] What else do I have to get done is set up. - Am I going to AWS re-invent?
[56:18] No, not currently. Unless someone wants to sponsor me to go, everybody,
[56:23] I'm open for work. - I am.
[56:30] - I am going to re-invent and we'll be finding you and Darko
[56:37] and Jackie and Julie. Dude, Wesley, we figured out,
[56:45] Julie and I grew up in the same, like, okay. And I don't know if, Erin, do you know Julie?
[56:51] - Julie. - With the last name.
[56:56] I will look up her Twitter. - I know a couple of Julies.
[57:01] - Anyway, she's phenomenal. And this is good for you to know too is he is from Idaho.
[57:18] - Yeah. - Here, I just posted her thing 'cause everybody should,
[57:31] if you're on using the Twitters where a lot of you find us, I just posted her Twitter and everyone should go follow her
[57:37] 'cause she's a dope soul. We found out that she's also from Idaho
[57:45] and she grew up in, or she had a lot of family and grew up in Pocatello,
[57:52] like some of the time. And Pocatello is where I grew up
[57:57] and she was telling me about this like crazy stuff, like twice abducted human and things.
[58:07] And then the week after she told me about it, she's like, don't look it up.
[58:10] You don't wanna look it up. It was on a podcast I listened to.
[58:13] And I was like, dude, that's crazy. - What, what, what?
[58:19] Yeah, no, we're both from Idaho, but I love how you say Pocatello
[58:24] because I've always referred to it the on the other half of Idaho as Pocahelphold.
[58:28] - I mean, that's fine, fair. Like that's not a bad thing.
[58:33] And for reference y'all, at least when I lived there, there's like the three biggest cities were back in the day,
[58:40] at least Boise by far, but then Pocatello and Idaho Falls. I think that's changed now.
[58:47] I think it's like Coeur d'Alene, Moscow. - Coeur d'Alene.
[58:52] Yeah, it's either Coeur d'Alene or Moscow. I don't know if they would call it both.
[58:55] - But yes, it's weird to meet other people from Idaho. - Yeah, especially in like the tech space
[59:06] and sectors sometimes. - Yeah, yeah.
[59:08] Anyway, Wesley, as a random other cool update to tell you about is we're launching
[59:15] the Ivan livestream tomorrow. It's gonna be fun and scary all at the same time.
[59:20] - Adios, Wesley. - He's like, "Bye."
[59:24] - He's like, "Okay, bye, I'm done." But to get back to what we also talked about too of,
[59:35] so you're somebody that can't do, that needs structure and don't do very well if like structure is like,
[59:46] that's as far as I remember. - Yeah, I don't remember where we were going.
[59:53] Oh, TL;DR, I like structure. Have fun in your meeting, Wesley.
[59:57] I like structure, but like not too much structure. Does that make sense?
[60:03] Is that a good way of putting it? - If I don't have things in place with deadlines
[60:23] that I won't get stuff done. - Yeah, I need a deadline.
[60:26] - And that gives me structure. But if I have too much structure,
[60:30] I also won't get anything done. Does that make sense?
[60:37] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[60:42] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[60:47] - Oh, now the song's on repeat. (upbeat music)
[61:17] - Okay, let's go change the song that's not as so apparently on repeat.
[61:31] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[61:41] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[61:46] (upbeat music) Okay, y'all, I posted the links for the Ivan livestream
[62:20] that I just posted. If y'all could like them, comment them, share them,
[62:28] I'd greatly appreciate it. And it also has the time zones,
[62:34] which is what reminded me that it is. Maddie, if you're still around,
[62:40] Learner was correct, and this is the time zones. (upbeat music)
[62:48] I just got a notification on my phone that somebody lost their tortoise.
[63:13] - How do you lose your tortoise? - Our plumber just left.
[63:17] Oh, I think they left the door open, like somebody left the door open.
[63:24] I mean, they're slow, but if the door's open long enough. (upbeat music)
[63:32] (upbeat music) - Do you need a coffee break?
[64:03] Go get yourself some coffee. - I think I might need to be getting
[64:05] another coconut sparkle water. And it's also.
[64:10] All right, guess what? - What?
[64:19] Is it done? Did you fix it?
[64:21] - I fixed it. I fixed it.
[64:24] - Yes. - Everybody can go look at it.
[64:28] I fixed some links. You can see my resume and hopefully hire me.
[64:31] - Yay. Hire Erin.
[64:38] Go hire Erin. Is this a dance song?
[64:43] - This is a, we need to find a dance song, 'cause I was like.
[64:46] This is like, if I did something cool, like. - Oh, hold on.
[64:56] I saw these earlier. - Um.
[65:00] - I'm gonna tweet this and then mask it on it and then all this stuff so you guys can follow it.
[65:13] - Okay. I'm gonna share my screen,
[65:20] so it hopefully shares the audio. (burps)
[65:27] (gentle music) - Do you like EDM music?
[65:38] - I like a lot of stuff. - Okay, cool.
[65:43] I wasn't sure. I had to check.
[65:45] - Yeah. - Oh, let me get rid of the ad first.
[65:48] - Okay. - And turn this off.
[66:02] And we wait for the ad. And hopefully this won't be too loud when I hit music.
[66:12] Okay, hold please. This is a wonderful ad.
[66:16] (keyboard clacking) Everybody, I don't even know what this is for.
[66:21] Vital Farms. Keeping it bullshit free.
[66:23] I appreciate it. - I feel like this isn't a very good start to it.
[66:29] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[66:35] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[66:40] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[66:45] (indistinct) I could leave this as our background music.
[67:12] (upbeat music) But then we can't share our screens.
[67:19] - I feel like you can upload it. Like if you download the file and then upload it.
[67:25] - Yeah. Let me see if I can do that.
[67:28] (keyboard clacking) (indistinct)
[67:37] - Working on it, y'all. - But I also,
[68:01] (keyboard clacking) I'm using this to simultaneously
[68:15] get the word out about the stream, but also simultaneously getting the word out about my page.
[68:23] So everybody, one second, and then I'll have more links for you to engage with.
[68:31] - Okay. - Are you on Mastodon, Jen?
[68:36] - I am. Would you like my Mastodon chat?
[68:41] - It's Jen. - All right.
[68:44] I'm on. - Here we go.
[68:46] - Okay. Okay.
[68:49] Then that's all I got. Okay.
[68:51] - I just like, was like trying to pull it. I was like, you know too many Jens.
[68:56] And I was like, but I want the Jen. - Yes, I am the Jen.
[69:01] (keyboard clacking) - I like it.
[69:08] Okay. We still, oh, maybe,
[69:13] maybe this will work. Do these, do these.
[69:21] Oh, dude. That's so weird.
[69:32] Do you ever, have you ever used a tool that you've used for such a long time
[69:38] and then you have to sign up again and ask you for your age and you're like, whoa.
[69:44] - Whoa. - I just, I'm trying to sign up for StreamYard
[69:49] to see if we can actually get this music to download from them to use.
[69:53] And it asked me my age and my age is 35. 35.
[70:00] And it felt really weird to type it. 'Cause I've, you know, like used it before.
[70:09] So yeah. Anyway.
[70:12] I'm feeling like an old lady. I am seriously all over the board,
[70:26] but hey, I'm getting stuff done that I meant to do at a different time.
[70:30] And I'm DMing someone that is a cool artist that I wanted their music on our show.
[70:42] And then I forgot to follow up. 'Cause that's what I do sometimes.
[70:49] (Hannah humming) The music.
[71:05] All right. So, I like how my phone,
[71:09] and my phone's just right there in the middle. I'm going to reply to them and be like, yo, can,
[71:19] we get some music. I highly doubt they're going to reply anytime soon.
[71:24] Probably not for this stream, but maybe next week. Log in.
[71:44] Thank you. (keyboard clicking)
[71:50] Where is this person? (Hannah humming)
[72:04] So, I found this human on TikTok. And then I was like, dude, your music's dope.
[72:12] And then hit them up on, (keyboard clicking)
[72:17] on the Instagrams. So, you could actually DM them.
[72:21] - Oh. - Everyone should go follow Graphic on the Instagrams
[72:28] just because that's where I posted it. - Let's see.
[72:33] - So, hopefully say what I'm trying to say out loud properly.
[72:38] We're going to ask him if he could create us like three hour playlist.
[72:44] Like maybe version one, version two, or at least a couple songs or something like that.
[72:49] Or like three hours worth of music and multiple playlists. - I love that.
[72:55] I'm going to go follow right away. And I just dropped in the chat all my links
[72:59] on what I worked on and published it in the world. So, if you see anything and you like it, please share it.
[73:06] Help me get a job because I like not being fun employed. (keyboard clicking)
[73:15] The end. - Woo, woo, woo.
[73:20] - Ooh, ooh, ooh. Wow, that really came in like a whole block of text there.
[73:33] Now, in between this, I am going to get some caffeine. - Do it.
[73:39] - I am going to finally follow up with this person from like January.
[73:45] - It's all good. I can cross off one activity.
[73:51] - Yay. - Next, we're going to send the email
[73:56] I've been procrastinating, which is actually like a five minute task,
[73:58] but it's one of those tasks that you like been avoiding. And it's like one of those, ooh, yeah.
[74:04] We're going to do that. But anywho, I'll BRB.
[74:07] - While I refill the coffee. - Do it.
[74:11] - Or get some kind of caffeine. So, I'll BRB.
[74:13] - Cup and toffee. - Enjoy, Jen, I'll be back.
[74:17] - That just sounds weird. Okay, let's go.
[74:27] What I was doing was also just trying to see if I could create a clip.
[74:38] I might have to do it post. Apparently we don't make a lot of clips.
[74:50] Let's see. Nope, nope.
[74:59] I got nothing. Collections, video producer.
[75:02] I can create a highlight. Okay.
[75:07] Which a highlight can be possibly enough time. What time is it?
[75:18] Okay. Are you editing?
[75:21] You guys can't hear what I'm looking at, but hey, I'm doing things.
[75:29], Oh, can I not create the clip yet? [75:34], Oh, can I not create the clip yet?
[75:39] Oh, can I not create the clip yet? Figuring this out y'all.
[76:06] (silence) Very concentrated.
[76:19] All the concentrated looks. Oh yeah, I'm totally gonna see if I could
[76:37] clip this to where they see the entire part of me trying to.
[76:51] I know there's so many links. They're all worthwhile.
[77:00] (silence) Share screen, window.
[77:26] This one. And then you guys are stuck listening to it too
[77:29] as I'm working on it. (silence)
[77:33] Nope, we're not there yet. (silence)
[77:41] I feel like this is a good spot to clip it. Okay, how do we want to name this one?
[78:04] Asking graphic for music or some of the amazing music.
[78:19] Okay, and add. Oh wait, no.
[78:25] What happened to the other one? We want this one.
[78:27] (silence) So the second one we don't want.
[78:31] I want this one. I'm sharing that I'm making a clip of us.
[78:41] But I don't know how to share it. Did it just make it?
[78:47] I don't know. I don't know.
[78:50] Clips. Clips I've created.
[78:56] I don't think it's that one. Publish highlights.
[79:02] Oh, I made a highlight. And I named it asking graphic for music.
[79:10] Yes. Okay, cool.
[79:12] Yay, we are done with that. That is exciting.
[79:15] That took a lot of effort just to get it figured out. (silence)
[79:24] Right. How do I get?
[79:27] Aha. (silence)
[79:33] (typing) Okay, cool.
[80:04] Yay, there's that. And now I can go focus on the more fun thing
[80:10] of sharing your stuff. And it does make it easier when I get tagged and stuff.
[80:21] Yes. Go hire Erin.
[80:33] (silence) Here, does anyone wants to see?
[80:37] I can get a break from my gamified break app. (laughs)
[80:43] Do it. If you can see, I have my little thing
[80:51] and now I'm watering my grass. What am I?
[80:53] There we go. I'm watering.
[80:55] And now I have 26 peas and I need to sell my plants. And I grew one plant.
[81:03] So now I have 32 peas, which are like the monies. I think I want to do a onion.
[81:10] And that's all I can afford 'cause I'm a broke-ass bitch.
[81:15] And then I water it. It's so cute.
[81:24] I think I can get like some snails or something. Oh, that's that.
[81:31] â™ª Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo â™ª Unlocked fiddlehead ferns in the fall.
[81:42] Unlock leaf. Costs five snails.
[81:45] I have 10 snails. It moves.
[81:57] That's funny. Okay, that's weird.
[81:58] Unlocked. Two.
[82:07] And we have eight. Okay, I guess I have to wait 'til more snails.
[82:15] Anyhow, that's it. That's all I was sharing.
[82:18] But I have green tea now. - Nice, nice.
[82:23] - 'Cause it is past the point in the day where if I have too much caffeine, I'm gonna vibrate.
[82:27] And let's be real, I shouldn't be vibrating. - Yes.
[82:33] I mean, I need to go water and all that too, of getting used to gotta take care of yourself
[82:45] and all the things and all this stuff. And I realized that I do better when I'm at home
[82:53] than I do when I'm traveling. So I'm like, I need to up my at home.
[82:58] - Yeah, I feel that. - And right now I'm trying to make us a nice playlist.
[83:13] That at least it would be 30 minutes on repeat if it's going to repeat.
[83:20] (keyboard clacking) We're gonna see if this works.
[83:26] (humming) We definitely do not need.
[83:39] We can do it at like this percent maybe. - They didn't paid out.
[83:50] - Oh no, I'm so sorry. If it didn't click the link to an article
[83:57] and it didn't load, that is so dumb. I will fix that.
[84:02] I will update. Thank you for that post.
[84:06] - Oh yeah, it's saying DNS probe finished and next domain. - Cool, so I gotta go.
[84:16] Awesome, let's go to my domain settings. - It does it just for your domain by itself too.
[84:23] - Weird, okay. Well, everybody thanks for catching me on that.
[84:27] - Do me a favor, write your domain. Let me grab your other domain really quick.
[84:36] Maybe like, I'm wondering if it's like a typo. I don't know.
[84:42] - I think it's the, whatever the settings where it's like, where you have to have the WWW in front of it.
[84:49] 'Cause I just got it if you don't put the WWW, which is fine, I'll just fix it.
[84:55] - I just clicked the one in chat and it worked. And you're right, this one doesn't.
[85:00] - So we're just gonna fix it real quick. - At least on LinkedIn, you can just edit it.
[85:10] - Yeah. Well, I'm also just gonna,
[85:15] that's something that should be fixed with my, anyway, that's like a, oh, okay, cool, cool, cool.
[85:20] It says. - It should be working.
[85:30] I don't know why it's not working. - My little game says that I have to actually,
[85:46] work. Ooh, interesting tongue.
[85:49] - Okay, I'm currently rendering this 30 minute video. We'll see if I can use that.
[86:07] But it is a video and I have to record it. Not in here yet.
[86:14] (keyboard clacking) - Ooh, I don't know if I told you,
[86:45] my YouTube account got to 200 followers. - Congrats, congrats.
[86:56] I just crossed, I think I like was bad and like, I feel like, lessons learned, Erin.
[87:02] This is, I'm gonna stand on my soapbox for the lessons learned.
[87:05] - Do it, do it. - Lessons learned.
[87:08] I feel like I neglected video content over the last little bit.
[87:12] And so I'm building a lot of that up right now. So I just crossed 30.
[87:16] If you want to follow me, you can go to. - Yes, please.
[87:19] - Yeah, everybody, Erin, got two links to my YouTube. It's pretty great.
[87:24] Yeah. - That is why I was saying something
[87:29] about asking people to follow here. Because it's like, I don't know,
[87:33] people don't always realize that they don't follow. So it's having to ask them to follow.
[87:42] - Yeah, so I just dropped my YouTube and my Twitch and yeah, follow, say hi.
[87:47] I'm pretty much on like all the platforms at Erin McHale. If you want to see my dog and comedy, it's on.
[87:52] Yeah, that's it. - Yay.
[88:00] in here. - If we could, that would be dope.
[88:29] It's thinking, it's a maybe. Where's my finder, finder, finder, finder.
[88:38] And then we go here. And then.
[88:45], okay, cool. Okay, cool, cool, cool, and I'll see how to do it, okay.
[88:55] Okay, cool, cool, cool, and I'll see how to do it, okay. Let's see what's,
[89:24] this used to be my favorite song on here. It's called Feeding the Ducks.
[89:30] - Oh yeah, nope. - It can get old though.
[89:34] And I know that, but I still love it. - I do like this one.
[89:38], that can be closed, that can be closed. That can be closed.
[90:02] Even that one, and that one, and that one. Oh yay.
[90:07] So many things to close. And then download.
[90:18] We get to download, I'm very excited. - Oh, the seller, nice.
[90:33] Yeah, comedy seller. - Yeah.
[90:35] - I'm curious now. - Yeah.
[90:45] My claim, like, is that I once did an open mic with Joe Pera there,
[90:56] from Joe Pera Talks With You, but he was in the same open mic that I was doing,
[91:01] which was really cool once. And then I sat there and I was like this
[91:04] the entire time, like, you're so cool.
[91:08] And you have to listen to my jokes. This is embarrassing.
[91:12] Yeah. So that's pretty cool.
[91:18] But if you want to see my comedy works, you can follow us on,
[91:22] my comedy crew has a comedy troupe. Outside of my personal comedy,
[91:29] I run a show in Brooklyn, where I use my weird coding skills to make things
[91:37] and weird production skills to make things. Actually, Jen, I think,
[91:41] can I play the video through the screen? - I think so, if you share the audio with it.
[91:46] So you have to share the tab or the window, I think. - I can, if anybody wants to see a quick little break video.
[91:54] - I do. - As I, and then Jen, make me send this email afterwards,
[91:59] 'cause I'm currently procrastinating. So we can only watch this
[92:02] and then everybody make sure that I send my reel afterwards. - Okay.
[92:08] - Yeah, I actually really like doing shows. It's really fun.
[92:11] It's like, if you like a stage, it's really cool, but not everybody likes that.
[92:16] So, see, I think this reel has my, me in it.
[92:23] I think, I mean, it's like our comedy collective. So it's like, there's five of us.
[92:30] It's just, share tab audio, so cool. - Okay, cool.
[92:33] Let me, oh, bam. - Bam.
[92:37] Ready? This is what I do outside of my day job.
[92:39] - Let's start it up. - Are you guys ready?
[92:43] - Yeah! - Humans are like my investors.
[92:48] Falling for promises and fairy tales without questioning the science behind it.
[92:54] Word. - You're as edgy as a butter knife.
[92:58] - The only thing getting hurt now is our eardrums. - Margo, you're so inclined with Bitcoin.
[93:03] I have to expect you to crash mid-set just like the market. - AI versus human roast battle.
[93:10] AI versus human roast battle. - It's an AI versus human roast battle.
[93:17] - We're going to round two where it's gonna be personal. Okay?
[93:21] And for round two, we brought a very special guest. He'll be the sidekick to Eric Andre the Ghost
[93:26] of the Eric Andre Show the next season. Give it up for Kyle Bostic, y'all!
[93:30] Kyle Bostic! (crowd cheering)
[93:34] - That face would make an Android blue picture. - Did you know Kyle's favorite drink is a Manhattan?
[93:49] That's right. He likes his drinks like it's comedy.
[93:52] Watered down and full of regret. (crowd cheering)
[93:57] - That was a great joke. (crowd laughing)
[94:13] - Let's see what else we got here. Oh, you guys might know this one.
[94:18] - And with this one, we're going to bring in a very special guest.
[94:23] Y'all know and love at the C-F-E dot D-E-V. Brian Rinaldi!
[94:29] - I'm not expecting I'll win. I think my AI opponent will probably beat me.
[94:34] - Introduce his opponent? Okay.
[94:35] - Let's see him, let's see him, let's see him. - I'm AI Brian Rinaldi.
[94:39] After I'm done roasting human Brian Rinaldi today, he's going to realize the true power of AI,
[94:43] not to mention having an identity crisis of epic proportions.
[94:46] Let's get this roast party started. - Wow.
[94:49] - Wow. - He's, he's pretty confident and creepy.
[94:54] Developer experience intermediate, you mean professional bug creator.
[94:58] Brian keeps himself employed by creating bugs he later has to fix.
[95:02] - Your coding style is like Schrodinger's cat, simultaneously alive and dead
[95:06] until someone opens your text editor. - He's not wrong.
[95:10] I gotta admit, he's not wrong. You could call Brian Rinaldi a world traveler,
[95:14] but in reality, he's seen the inside of a bunch of tech conferences
[95:17] and used a VPN more than once. - Coding with you is like navigating through the labyrinth
[95:22] from the movie "Labyrinth," except David Bowie's not here to make it interesting.
[95:26] - The only reason people discover your dev relish podcast is because they thought it was a cooking show.
[95:31] (upbeat music) - Oh.
[95:33] - The way you handle errors in your code is like a multiverse theory.
[95:37] Every error opens up. - But yeah, that's pretty much it.
[95:40] - I'm very amused. - This is, this is what I do outside of my day job.
[95:47] - And maybe could possibly become your day job. - Yeah.
[95:54] Actually, technically right now it is my day job. - All job?
[96:00] - All job. That's the only job,
[96:02] that's the only thing I'm making money from right now, so. - All job.
[96:05] It's your job. - All job.
[96:07] It's my job. I'm a comedian, I'm a full-time.
[96:08] I actually did open my setup on, literally, so I got laid off on Friday.
[96:12] I opened up my set on Saturday with, you know, I'm really excited to make the step
[96:18] into being a full-time comedian. And my work loved it so much
[96:21] that they gave me three months to get started. - I like it though.
[96:29] - I like it. Everybody laughed until they realized what it was
[96:31] and I was like, yeah, it's me. - I wonder if it would,
[96:39] I don't, I of course haven't seen the skip, but if it, they gave you three months to get a headstart
[96:47] and then, although, whether or not I come back is indefinite.
[96:52] - I went into, from that one, I went into my joke and then I started my set with,
[96:59] I've been starting my set lately with my little comedy bit on,
[97:03] and it's like, you know, in tech I've been through the trifecta.
[97:07] I've been through a layoff. I've been through a layoff, an acquisition,
[97:15] but not the fun kind where you make money, the fun kind where you lose your job,
[97:19] and an explosion, but not an implosion 'cause implosions are for submarines.
[97:23] So that's how I started my set. And it's been working out really well.
[97:29] That and poop jokes, man. You know, people coming back to my show
[97:35] for poop jokes and startup layoffs. So keep the content coming.
[97:41] - What is your favorite, not like what the audience is favorite,
[97:46] like the biggest reaction, but what is your favorite joke?
[97:49] Like that you're most excited about? - I do like my human centipede one a lot.
[97:57] That one is always fun because I think the people who get it,
[98:01] they like, once they get it, it's like great. And that's the one I'm like,
[98:05] I'm gonna spice up my marriage by taking advice from human centipede.
[98:08] You have to be careful what happens. You go from mouth to ass.
[98:11] And then I have a bit that I like about politics. And it's like, you know,
[98:20] when I originally went to school, I wanted to be a politician
[98:24] and I turned out, I wanted to be in politics, but it turns out that I'm not qualified
[98:30] because I don't come from money and I'm not related to anybody famous.
[98:35] But I recently found out, which is this is a true story,
[98:37] that I'm distantly related to the cast of "Extreme Loggers." So now I'm a sex tape away from being overqualified.
[98:44] Those are probably my favorite two. They're kind of dumb.
[98:50] I like it. - I like dumb jokes.
[98:54] I feel like it's really weird about comedy. And this is oddly a big reason
[99:02] I don't go to a lot of comedy shows or anything because a lot of comedy is like making fun of other people.
[99:10] Or, and I get really cringey and I'm like, don't, like, no. Like it's-
[99:18] - You gotta punch up. You gotta punch up.
[99:20] - So I really struggle with it. And like, even if you're thinking like movies,
[99:28] like "Stepbrothers" makes me cringe. And I'm like, it's sad.
[99:32] It's annoying because everybody else is like, this is the funniest.
[99:35] And I'm like, I wish I could watch it. But we started watching "Beef" on Netflix
[99:44] and it's called dark humor. It's like about dark humor.
[99:50] And I'm like, why do I like dark humor but I don't like cringey humor?
[99:53] 'Cause the shit is dark. Also, it's amazing.
[99:58] - I'm probably in the same boat though. 'Cause like I am in this, yeah, very similar boat.
[100:03] Like I'm a big dark humor person. I have a few darker humor,
[100:07] but it's like, I also think you need to balance it. Like there was a, I did a show recently
[100:11] and on the show, like there was some comics that like took it really dark.
[100:14] And I was like, there was no like moments of brevity. And so it was like, everybody was like, oh man.
[100:20] Oh, oh man. Oh man, it's a lot.
[100:24] - Yeah. - So yeah, I think that's like,
[100:26] finding that balance is great. - Yeah.
[100:30] - Yeah. - I think that's like, finding that balance is great.
[100:33] - I linked the YouTube in case anybody wants to go check it out on their own time.
[100:40] Because the entire reason we need to pivot is Erin needs to do the email.
[100:46] - I, hey, I have actually been drafting it. Weirdly, you just like sitting here watching
[100:51] has been great and like making me do it. Everybody, I will let you know.
[100:56] I mean, I replied to two other emails, but not the one. - You did two other emails first, okay.
[101:02] - Yeah, this is like, it's one of those emails where it's like, it's one of those emails where it's like,
[101:07] it's not a bad email. - Emails that go into emails?
[101:11] - It's like, I'm opening a can of worms with this email. And I just like, I'm not ready for the can of worms to open.
[101:17] - Fair. - Does that make sense?
[101:20] - Yeah. - It's like about our comedy stuff.
[101:22] And it's like, I know that as soon as I send this, like it's gonna open up a lot of questions.
[101:26] And like right now, because I'm a full-time comedian, I'm going in everybody else's jobs,
[101:33] I'm going to have to deal with this. So it's like, yeah, yeah, that's where I'm at.
[101:39] But I'm gonna do it. We're gonna do, I've typed it in the email bar.
[101:46] We're doing it. - That's good.
[101:51] - Anywho, go back to talking and I'm gonna just do this while.
[101:54] - Oh my God. I've been working on getting this damn audio file
[101:59] under 30 megabytes and I'm at 30.3. I don't think they're gonna let me upload it,
[102:05] but I'm gonna try. Y'all I'm trying to get us better music,
[102:09] but like I want a playlist because it puts them on repeat. Like you manually have to go click them.
[102:17] Okay. Are you gonna let me upload it?
[102:20] I don't know. Processing.
[102:23] And y'all I didn't listen to the music beforehand. I just picked a bunch.
[102:29] I'm also curious about the music I picked. And I think it's 20 minutes long, 21 minutes long.
[102:37] So we will have background music here shortly. So in the meantime, we'll do Jeopardy.
[102:45] (humming) Did they get the song?
[102:53] Because it kind of reminds me of "I'm a Little Teapot." - Now that you say that, I can only hear my,
[102:58] "I'm a Little Teapot." - Yeah.
[103:01] You're welcome. You know what?
[103:06] I feel like I'm not getting any of my to-do list done because they're all like high brain power things.
[103:14] And that's not working right now. But I, oh, I think it worked.
[103:24] Okay, hold on. Let me rename it.
[103:28] Of 20 minute playlist. And, and what do we got?
[103:37] I hope this doesn't like hurt anybody's ears. (upbeat music)
[103:45] (humming) The best music, but it's music.
[103:56] This is exciting. Okay.
[104:06] Now I just need to actually find music I like for 20 minutes.
[104:09] We can do that another day. (upbeat music)
[104:17] Oh. â™ª Do do do, we wanna start â™ª
[104:32] â™ª And then we want to â™ª Oh, that's the...
[104:37] I don't know why I struggle with Mastodon so much. (upbeat music)
[104:42], okay. Okay.
[105:08] Okay. (upbeat music)
[105:42] I can show you guys what I'm working on. It's very exciting stuff.
[105:45] I need to make barcodes. Oh, I got to do other barcodes.
[106:00] But I also need a thank you screen. This one only needs to be like a minute.
[106:06] Like at the end. So bam, one minute.
[106:13] Also doesn't need a timer, but that's okay. We'll get rid of that in a second.
[106:19] It's the, hey, thanks for joining. We appreciate you.
[106:23] Okay, bye. But to like tell people where we are.
[106:36] Wait, wait, wait a second. There we go.
[106:50] This is a weird tool. In case anyone is curious,
[106:54] I am using wave.video right now. And I just started using this tool.
[107:10] So I have no idea where everything is. Here we go.
[107:18] Add new. None.
[107:24] And I would like you to be, that's kind of fun.
[107:32] Maybe this. Okay.
[107:35] Okay. Is it like this?
[107:41] Oh. Ew, why's that one coming out?
[107:46] I don't know why am I not just making this in Canva. Oh, because I want it to be a video.
[108:10] That's why. Hmm.
[108:13] Well, why don't we do that instead then? I can make a Canva thing.
[108:23] And then I just have to open. Ooh, as I throw my mic at myself.
[108:30] It's really fun. You guys should try it.
[108:33] Like hit the mic when you're talking and stuff, 'cause you talk with your hands or throw it at yourself.
