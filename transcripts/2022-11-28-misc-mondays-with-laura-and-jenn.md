[00:00] >> Hello, hello, beautiful humans. Welcome to another episode of Teach Gen Tech
[00:06] with our amazing guest, Miss Mondays, Laura. >> I'm going to just push back.
[00:12] I'm not a guest, I'm a co-host. >> That is true.
[00:16] >> Hi, I'm Laura, and I'm pedantic. But I'm also a technical writer,
[00:26] and so it's also my job. >> Yes, yes.
[00:31] >> Before that, I was a mathematician, and so it was really my job.
[00:35] >> She is the co-host on Mondays. We need to say this a lot because I am not used to it,
[00:45] like saying co-host, but it's so true. Good morning, homie.
[00:53] >> Hey, homie. Hey, Jay. >> What up, Jay?
[00:57] >> All right, I need to do my "treats," "treats," "tweets." >> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:07] >> But we're live. >> I mean, I know we say this every Monday,
[01:10] and this is going to be super boring, but I'm just going to say it again,
[01:13] that I really like starting Mondays with y'all. And I mean, you, Jen, but also, like,
[01:21] homie is always with us on Mondays. And then there's sort of, like, a rotating, you know,
[01:27] list of folks, like Jail Droppin', Ben, and Kari, and so on.
[01:36] And then there are, like, other people whose names I don't know as well because I haven't seen them as many times.
[01:41] But, yeah, it's just so nice. We're like the Monday club.
[01:46] >> Oh, I like that. The Monday club.
[01:49] For breakfast, we are Mondays. Although that could be kind of weird
[01:55] because we're not in detention. >> Detention?
[02:00] >> Breakfast club. Aren't they in detention Saturday?
[02:04] >> I've never seen that. >> What?
[02:07] I actually get to say that because everybody says that about every film almost ever to me.
[02:11] And I'm like, "Dude, I don't watch movies." But that is exciting that you haven't seen it
[02:18] because it's like, if you do watch it, you may really like it.
[02:25] >> Maybe, maybe. I don't know.
[02:30] I did see Pretty in Pink. >> Okay.
[02:34] >> Which I think that's, like, the same. What were they?
[02:39] It's a play on the Brat Pack, right? Isn't that what they were called?
[02:44] It was, like, Molly Ringwald and other people's names. I don't know.
[02:52] And, yeah. And so I've seen that one, and I don't like it.
[02:58] And I don't know. Like, I wonder if it's one of those things,
[03:02] like, you either had to see it in the time that it was made or when you were, like, the age of the people
[03:13] who were in it or something. >> I feel like you're talking about my psyche
[03:19] because I watch way too many, like, high school-aged TV shows.
[03:28] >> Gotcha. Yeah, okay.
[03:32] I can see that. The only one that I...
[03:35] Hey! The only one that I've, like, high school-type show
[03:42] that I've seen as an adult is Veronica Mars. >> Ooh, that one's so good.
[03:50] >> That one is so good. Actually, that's not quite true because I tried
[03:55] to, like, Buffy the Vampire Slayer. >> Okay.
[03:59] >> I can't do it. Nope.
[04:01] >> Oh. I love Veronica Mars, and I watched...
[04:08] One of my current faves is Never Have I Ever, which is a great show, and...
[04:18] >> Sex Education. I have seen Sex Education on Netflix,
[04:21] and that's totally a high school show. I mean, not everybody in it is high school,
[04:25] but anyway, a lot of them are. So that...
[04:28] >> I don't think I've seen that one. >> That is an exception.
[04:30] It's really good. >> All right.
[04:32] Yeah, I watch way too many high school ones. There's more, but I can't log into my Netflix,
[04:37] and then we'll get really distracted. And as a...
[04:41] Just a thank you to everyone, A, for joining us today, because it's Monday.
[04:45] Also, thank you, everyone, for helping with getting the fact that I'm looking for work out
[04:53] and retweeting and reposting and all that fun stuff. I appreciate you.
[05:02] >> Oh, yeah. >> So I don't know who those people are.
[05:09] So I don't know. What I can't do is...
[05:12] So this is the same reason that I couldn't... My husband tried to get me to watch Lucifer,
[05:20] and it was the same thing. I just cannot be doing with demons and stuff.
[05:27] I cannot. The closest...
[05:31] The only demon that I can get on with is the good omen style, where they're like demons, but don't look weird, I guess.
[05:43] >> Okay. >> I mean, I get along fine with humans who look weird
[05:48] by cultural standards or whatever, but no. I can't.
[05:54] And werewolves and vampires and stuff. And vampires, I don't know.
[06:00] It's the same. I can't do sort of like standard type superheroes,
[06:07] but I loved Jessica Jones and Luke Cage, but I could not do the Defenders because whoever...
[06:17] The other two in there, there was the guy... I don't even know who the other two were in there,
[06:23] but I tried, but they were too like standard superhero-y, and I could not deal with it.
[06:29] They wore costumes! They wore costumes!
[06:31] No! >> Mm-hmm.
[06:33] >> All right. So just like thought process back.
[06:41] Okay, first, I love all the fantasy, vampire, everything. Like Firefly and any type of sci-fi and all of that
[06:58] is, oh, yay. Really quick.
[07:04] Were the ads super annoying? Because I turn them on on my stream just because they're like,
[07:10] "Hey, if you turn on your ads, you can make some money." And I'm like, "I've been jobless for a while, so."
[07:19] So y'all, please let me know if you get really annoyed with them. But I just got done listening, listening, reading.
[07:29] We'll go with that. The Marnie...
[07:31] Now I have to... Finished.
[07:33] Finished. Please go to finished.
[07:37] The Marnie Baranuik files, like 100 hours of listening time. I did it in a week.
[07:46] Granted, I do listen on double time, but it was fantastic. Even the fact of superhero movies, because I normally love them.
[07:55] Like I loved Jumanji, but there was a movie that was sadly super disappointing, Black Adam, which had The Rock in it.
[08:11] And The Rock is normally like a fantastic, or Dwayne Johnson is normally such a good actor.
[08:19] But no, it was really sad. You know, I don't think I've ever actually seen him in anything.
[08:25] Watch Jumanji's. Watch the Jumanji.
[08:28] Okay. Okay.
[08:30] Well, okay. My kid has watched Moana.
[08:36] So I have heard Dwayne Johnson in something. And I don't know how much of the, like I know that when they were filming Aladdin, they
[08:50] were like recording Robin Williams in the sound booth. And like a lot of the movements of the genie were based on like what Robin Williams was
[09:03] doing in the sound booth. But I don't know if that's always the case.
[09:09] Like I don't know necessarily, I have no idea how much the movements of the character that was voiced by Dwayne Johnson were informed by the movements of Dwayne Johnson in the
[09:20] sound booth. If that makes sense.
[09:23] Wait, didn't, oh, for Moana. Yeah.
[09:27] Okay. Because I was like, but Smith did the new genie.
[09:33] Oh. I'm following.
[09:35] I'm following. Yeah.
[09:37] And I'm being pedantic again, because what I said was I had not seen eyeballs, Dwayne Johnson in anything.
[09:46] And then I was, I was pedantizing myself being like, wait, wait, maybe kind of I've seen because of, you know, anyway.
[09:55] Yes. And I, I did like that movie and yesterday, I don't really like Flash and Shazam and stuff.
[10:06] I have, maybe I just don't like DC. I've kind of sad because I just, I just saw the new, oh my gosh, y'all, you need to go
[10:18] see Wakanda forever. If you have not like, please stop what you're doing and go watch it.
[10:25] Like I've heard that it's really good. I haven't seen it either, but it's on my list.
[10:31] I woke up to go see it at an 8am showing because I was like, everyone's talking about it in opening night.
[10:37] And it was, it was fantastic. Yes, yes.
[10:45] And Jay, I've never really liked Batman's. I like Wonder Woman, the first one, but 1984 was also like, lost me.
[11:00] And yes, Ben, go see it. Go see it.
[11:04] I don't know what you think. I've never actually seen Knives Out.
[11:11] Have you seen Knives Out? So I have been trying, it's, it's, I have not seen it because it's the kind of film
[11:21] and this, there's like the list of films that I can watch with my whole family. I mean, maybe not the five-year-old, but like my teenagers and my parents, that list is
[11:32] very small, right? And so I don't want to just watch it by myself, but it's been this long that we've been trying
[11:41] to make it happen because that's hard. So it might be 10 years before I see Glass Onion, but I'll let you know.
[11:52] I'm Googling this y'all, see if I can spell knives. No, I want Knives Out, the first one.
[12:02] I can't Batman because I hate Batman. Like the character of Batman, that is some toxic masculinity.
[12:11] I'm just like, the dude, like Batman, the dude, like the entire, you can't, you can't, it would be really hard to play Batman.
[12:22] I would think in a way that isn't that, because that's like the character of Batman. Yeah, yeah, I cannot stand the, yeah, the entire, absolutely nothing.
[12:39] The only character when I've seen some Batman films and the only character that I can be like, yeah, I can, I can jive with you is the butler.
[12:50] Yeah, he was, I'm not sure what his name was, but Alfred, right, Alfred, because I've got software named Alfred and I just figured out that that's why the software is called Alfred.
[13:05] Right? That's got to be it.
[13:08] Uh, Ben just said Adam West Batman feels like it gets the furthest from toxic masculinity. Um, I, wait a minute, is that the like, like graphic, like pow, blam, like cartoons?
[13:29] You know what I'm talking about? Right?
[13:33] Like it showed up on the screen. It was really old.
[13:36] Oh, I lied because the other, there is another character from Batman that I could, I could be into, or I mean, was totally into, um, and that was the Eartha Kitt Catwoman.
[13:48] That's it. Um, onomatopoeias, yes.
[13:54] Okay. Okay.
[13:56] So Veronica Mars and onomatopoeia. So I could never remember what onomatopoeia meant until an episode of Veronica Mars, when,
[14:08] uh, two people go home together and then, uh, the next shot is the two of them in bed and clearly things have just gone down.
[14:19] And one of them says to the other, Hey, I thought you said you wanted to crash. And the other one says, Oh, sorry, I got my onomatopoeia mixed up and bang.
[14:30] And I have never forgotten what onomatopoeia meant ever since, because that was so good. I'm getting lost, but that's okay.
[14:40] And I Googled it. This is this y'all.
[14:43] If you were curious about what I do a lot of times in Laura's screens, Google shit as she's talking, um, it's the best way of learning cause I like can pick up things by context.
[14:55] This is how I've always read or conversed with people yet around Laura, it's safe enough to like go, okay, I don't know this.
[15:06] Let me go Google. And then if I need to ask further where a lot of other people, I'm just like, no, nope.
[15:15] Or it's like normal conversation where you don't really have a chance to do it. Yeah.
[15:20] Um, so I wanted to say to Jay, I use, I only do one thing, which is open apps. Like I'll do like options, space, Docker options, space, whatever, because I don't know most
[15:40] of them, but I would love to, if you would be interested, Jay, in coming on a stream sometime and teaching me automations, I would be eternally grateful.
[15:55] That's all bye Bakari. Hope she feels better.
[16:02] And yeah. Can you link Alfred?
[16:06] Because I'm like Googling it and oh, it's soft. Oh, I just found it.
[16:10] I was looking at the links itself and then, uh, it's like big dropdown on the side. Um, oh, that's cool.
[16:21] Here's some, some linky links y'all. Um, okay.
[16:30] And oh, for everyone watching, make sure to go check out Laura's stream tomorrow because Ben is going to be on Laura's stream.
[16:38] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, let me drop a link, I guess that would be potentially useful.
[16:44] What up, what up, hack? And as a heads up, since you are on the YouTubes instead of Twitch, uh, not everyone may, might
[17:00] not see you. Wow.
[17:02] I can talk. I promise.
[17:04] I promise. I can talk.
[17:06] Some days. Why did that not be, thank you.
[17:12] There's also Raycast, which is the new hotness, but I'm loyal. That is Raycast.
[17:19] Y'all always teach me so much. Can you add people on here?
[17:34] What do you mean? Well, like I've been trying to tag Ben in my, I'm going to drop a link to my stream
[17:46] for tomorrow and I'm trying to tag Ben in it, but. I don't know if you can from stream, Yarn.
[18:01] Yeah. Okay.
[18:07] Maybe. Yay.
[18:12] Cool. That works.
[18:22] Well. I don't know Raycast.
[18:25] I've got, I've got some sunk cost fallacy going on with Alfred, because I have purchased like a lifetime subscription or whatever, and I've already learned the muscle memory
[18:43] of like invoking Alfred on my keyboard. So I'm like team Alfred now.
[18:51] I'm not even going to look at Raycast because I'm going to be loyal too. Fair enough.
[19:00] Fair enough. Y'all Laura came up with a good thing for us to, to work on today.
[19:07] You were talking about key, key shortcuts, and this is something, especially if Jay's here too, this will work great.
[19:19] Y'all, for who has been watching the stream for a while, I'm going to present my screen. Screen.
[19:28] There we go. If I go into, I also don't know why this is here, but let me make this giant.
[19:42] I believe you said it was command L. Yeah. So command L does get rid of it.
[19:50] Yay. That is good news.
[19:52] I do CD, desktop, code, and PG&T. I do code dot, it is not found.
[20:09] Hi Ian, y'all, I, I am going to go back to my, my Twitch and how do I, I need to do a shout out for on, at least on this Twitch.
[20:29] I don't know how, but Ian y'all go follow Ian because Ian really, really helped with me not realizing that the reason my resume wasn't being viewed, I've been using it for
[20:43] six months and it wasn't passing ATS. That's a thing because Canva exported it and as a PDF, but it caused a bunch of spaces
[20:59] in the words. So the words were there, there were just spaces and I didn't know that was a thing.
[21:07] So, but yeah, so go watch Ian streams, go talk to Ian, Ian is just a rock star and yeah. So and thank you everyone again, because some of you have joined later for sharing the,
[21:29] my posts on everything. I greatly, greatly appreciate it because I need a job and to my attention that people
[21:41] didn't know how badly I needed a job. So if you have not shared yet, I will totally, because I don't normally do this you know,
[21:54] put everything in here for the link so you can share, share all the things, share all the things, please and thank you.
[22:01] All right. More exciting matters than me needing a job of fixing the ZSH, which is shell, right?
[22:14] Yes. So I'm told, cause I read it as Zsh, I'm told that it is pronounced Zshell.
[22:20] Zshell. Okay.
[22:22] Yeah. The SH is short for shell, which makes sense because like, to me, the, the other option
[22:27] and they're actually, there are more than one, there's more than one other option, but the other option, like the default is bash.
[22:35] And then there's, that's the bash shell. And then there's the Zshell and there's also fish and there are other options as well.
[22:43] They're all different bundles of the same idea. It's like the same, just like, okay, this is a terrible analogy, but it's like super
[22:57] high level. If you squint really hard and don't think about it, then it's like, Chrome is a browser
[23:03] and so is Safari and blah, blah, blah. You just read my mind as an example.
[23:08] That is creepy. Like it's so cool and creepy.
[23:13] This is how y'all know that Laura and I have been hanging out and streaming for a long time is-
[23:19] You know what? I don't think that that's why, because I think it's better than that.
[23:23] I don't know if you were an Anne of Green Gables type child, but I was an Anne of Green Gables type child and Anne referred to people as kindred spirits.
[23:33] That is true. And I would-
[23:36] I think we were kindred spirits before we had been streaming for a while. That's what I think.
[23:44] Yeah. That's true.
[23:46] That's true. Thanks to Ramon for introducing us.
[23:49] Yeah. And Ramon might join us later, I believe he's also streaming right now.
[24:00] So maybe in a bit, maybe in a bit. And so Hector just put in YouTube, so I'll share this.
[24:11] What up Hector? And yes, you would think that fixes it.
[24:16] For most people it does. For most people it does.
[24:23] So let's go to VS Code. I don't like that I can't bring it up with VS Code, like VS, like I have to do anyway.
[24:36] So we go in here, you can tell it's recently used, I do it every time, and we will not fully close it, and voila, it works.
[24:52] Yes, it breaks every time, every time I close terminal, it breaks. Okay.
[25:02] And that used to happen to me too. Okay.
[25:06] So one thing to check, so you are using Zshell. So what we need to see is what is actually in your Zshell's dot file, which is like,
[25:21] it's kind of like a, dot files in general are sort of like, often like configuration files or like preferences are often stored, like all the preferences that you can edit
[25:33] can be stored potentially as, in a dot file and things like that. And so we're going to look at the dot file associated with your Zshell.
[25:46] And I like to do that using Vim, but you can do it using code. And since you have just, it's working right now, right?
[25:55] Code, whatever is working as a command. Okay.
[25:58] So go to your home directory. So do CD with nothing after it.
[26:05] Okay. And now type code, space, tilde, slash, dot, Z-S-H-R-C, H not C. Z-S-H. Yeah.
[26:33] Oh yeah, Hector, I'm not sure if I've seen you around here tons, but yeah, this is a thing that I do.
[26:44] I teach people how to do things like the, you can, if you give a man a fish, he can eat for a day.
[26:49] And if you teach a man a fish, he can eat for whatever. I do like, I cannot help myself.
[26:55] I never just tell people the answers. I'm really bad at just telling people the answers.
[27:02] I used to be a teacher, a math professor actually. And so, yeah, I don't, I don't just tell people, I teach people.
[27:10] If you're starving, I'm going to give you a fish and then teach you to fish. Right.
[27:15] But you know, in general, if you're not starving, okay. So all you have in your Z-Shell configuration type file is this export path, Volta.
[27:32] Ooh, I don't know what Volta is. I have some associations.
[27:36] I associate Volta with Jason Langstroth actually, because I was just looking at Jason's dot files yesterday, because I am trying to learn more about what I can put in my dot files
[27:48] to optimize my life. But yeah.
[27:51] Do you know what Volta is, Jen? I've heard of it.
[28:00] It's a thing. I know that it is a thing.
[28:04] Cool. Nope.
[28:06] No, nothing. And just as a really, really quick, thank you, Ramon, for writing in.
[28:15] Yay. And thank you everyone for the follows.
[28:19] When you're here on Mondays, who knows what Laura and I are going to talk about. She helps co-host and we have miscellaneous Mondays and we just try to do, we just do
[28:31] a bunch of random shit. And today we are fixing the fact that my code dot doesn't work if I open it from terminal.
[28:39] And yes, Ben is very accurate. When I tried to fix this once, I broke my bash, shell, whatever it's called, the shell,
[28:51] I broke it. I broke it hard.
[28:53] I broke my entire computer. And Anthony had to come on the stream and help me fix it.
[28:58] Wow. Okay.
[29:00] Well, I'm scared now, because I didn't know that that was a possibility, but we're just going to pretend that it's not a possibility and carry on.
[29:10] And if we break everything, I'm really sorry. It's cool.
[29:13] I'm literally burning my computer and just like wiping it. So we're fine.
[29:19] But worst case, I'm just going to bug Anthony and be like, "Hey, you haven't been on the stream for a while.
[29:24] Come help me." How would you like to come fix this problem again?
[29:28] Yeah. Okay.
[29:30] So I am, I'm trying to think about how I want to send this, I'm just going to send you my entire file, my Z shell RC, but I'm trying to think how to do it.
[29:43] You want to email it? You want to...
[29:48] You know what? I have been meaning to put this, I have been meaning to back up my Z shell to GitHub anyway
[29:55] for my own sakes. I'm going to back it up.
[29:57] And then you can just pull it down from there and we'll be like technical. Yes.
[30:02] Take it. And until then, I'll just awkwardly talk at everyone.
[30:07] You know what? I could share my screen and then we can walk through how we're going to do this because
[30:15] I don't actually already have a plan for how I'm going to do this. So we're going to just wing it together if you don't mind.
[30:24] Jen. Yeah.
[30:26] Okay. Sorry.
[30:28] I just looked down and there's, I got subscriptions and thank you for everyone. I appreciate it.
[30:38] Let me just get in here. So I got distracted, which I know you're pretty used to.
[30:46] You know what? We are, you know, in Alice in Wonderland, there's the, like, we're all mad here.
[30:53] And that's, I feel that way in like a neurodiversity sense. But I always have to preface that I do not mean mad in like a derogatory sense when I
[31:05] say that. I mean it in like the most affectionate and awesome sense, but we're all mad here.
[31:12] I concur. And also y'all, this is one of my favorite things about streaming with Laura is it's
[31:24] a safe space. It's a secure space because this is why I officially, like, just love streaming with
[31:34] Laura. Likewise.
[31:36] Thanks. Let me just, I'm, I, my organization works in GitHub and so I just realized I needed
[31:47] to make sure that I wasn't going to be like posting closed source type stuff as opposed to, or like not posting, but like screen-sharing.
[31:55] Yeah, I get you. I'm ready now.
[32:00] Jay just shared also the, a Stack Overflow one. So if we need that, and also what up Catacorn, that's a fun name.
[32:16] Yeah. Oops.
[32:18] Let me just, oh, actually I need my whole screen anyway, so that's fine. Where did GitHub go?
[32:35] Here we go. And.
[32:38] Okay. Momentary inception.
[32:40] Here we are. Okay.
[32:43] So I think that what I'm going to do is what I've seen people do before, which is have a dot files repo.
[32:55] So I'm going to create a repository that is going to be dot files. It can be public.
[33:19] That's fine. I will add a readme, but I'm not going to fill it out yet.
[33:23] Can you make the text bigger? Oh, for sure.
[33:27] Yeah. Cause I know, I'll always, I'll also watch it in Twitch instead because StreamYard, it's
[33:36] like so small. Oh, okay, sure.
[33:42] And bye, Jay. I will keep you posted.
[33:47] Okay. So I'm going to copy this.
[33:51] I'm going to go into my terminal and my terminal is already showing my Z shell. So we will come back to that in a minute.
[34:03] And clear out. There we go.
[34:08] So that it's tidy. And I'm going to paste my, I'm going to get, oops, I forgot to type get clone first.
[34:19] I'm going to clone business. Oh, I can't see that one either.
[34:36] Very well. So my bad.
[34:38] Let me make that bigger. The destination path dot files already exists and it's not an empty directory.
[34:43] Of course it's not because I already have dot files. So I'm going to rename my repository.
[34:49] I think you have to do that in settings and it gets very particular, danger, danger, danger. No.
[35:00] Oh, I don't have to go through the danger part. I'm going to go, these are my dot files and I'm going to camel case just in case that's
[35:15] helpful for accessibility reasons. I think it's probably not because I've already put the underscore in there, but anyway, that'll
[35:24] be something I can chat about with Ben tomorrow. Okay.
[35:29] So I'm going to try again, get clone. Yep.
[35:36] Okay. And so here's the part where I'm not totally sure if this is going to be kosher.
[35:42] What I want to do is move my Z shell, my Z shell RC into this directory. I'm not sure whether that is going to make my computer unhappy.
[35:58] So we're going to find out, here we go. So I'm going to move actually, I probably need to see the into my files, but I need
[36:11] to know, is it actually called dot files or is it got dot files? Because sometimes things are hidden.
[36:20] And the way that we can check to see, we can see the entire list of everything that's available as opposed to everything that's not a, that doesn't have a dot in front of it.
[36:30] Those are called hidden directories. So if I want to see everything, including the hidden directories, instead of just typing
[36:35] LS, I have to then put a space and then LA, which is like list all, I'm not sure if that's exactly what the A stands for, but that's what it stands for in my brain.
[36:44] Okay. Okay.
[36:46] Okay. And so now we can see some of these things that would have not shown up if I had just
[36:54] done a regular LS, they're all the ones that start with dots. And so I can see my dot Z shell RC is there.
[37:09] It's not in a different directory, which means I can just, I don't have to like CD into a different directory before I move it.
[37:15] I can just move it. And I don't have to specify the directory because that's the other way that I could
[37:20] do it. So I can just move dot C to the repo that I just made, which was let me see.
[37:34] So I need a tilde slash and I think it was my, and I'm, I just pressed tab. I don't know if you're familiar with tab completions in yeah.
[37:46] So I'm going to tab into the, my dot files and I'm really quick. Could you, first off, what is the font?
[37:53] And then can you also make a terminal bigger, please? The window bigger or the font bigger?
[38:02] Both. Okay.
[38:04] Please. Yes.
[38:06] I can do that. I'm going to just make it go all be the entire left-hand side and also bigger the font.
[38:14] How's that? Yes.
[38:17] At least that looks good for me. Ramon, what you thinking?
[38:25] Much much better. Thank you.
[38:27] Okay, cool. Oh, and you also asked a question about what the font is.
[38:31] Yes. And I believe it is Anonymous Pro, which is my favoritest, where am I, I need to be
[38:38] in preferences. Settings.
[38:40] They call it preferences. Appearance.
[38:42] Oh no, it's in profiles. I always want it to be in appearance, but it's not, it's in profiles.
[38:52] Text. Okay.
[38:54] So it's Anonymous Pro, regular size 16, because Anonymous Pro is much smaller than other fonts. So where another font I might use 12 with Anonymous Pro, I'll use 16.
[39:13] And anti-aliased, we can see the difference with the anti-aliasing, what the difference that it makes.
[39:20] I don't, well, okay, actually it's kind of hard to see on here. Okay.
[39:26] So here it is without the anti-aliasing on, and here it is anti-aliased, and it just makes it a bit easier for me to read.
[39:39] I don't know about y'all. All that matters is that it makes it easier for you to read.
[39:45] Yeah. Okay.
[39:47] Yeah. This is my favorite font I use for anything.
[39:51] It's my favorite monospaced font. Let me clarify.
[39:55] My favorite monospaced font, not my favorite font overall, but it is the one that I use for everything where a monospaced font makes more sense, like coding in the terminal.
[40:06] Okay. So now I'm going to finally move that thing.
[40:10] And so now if I go into my .files, and I -- why is it not there? Okay.
[40:39] It's not still here, so why is it not -- all right, I don't know. Oh, maybe I need to CD into the . -- because it's a .file, I'm going to try CDing into
[41:23] the -- no. Oh, no, look.
[41:30] It's right there. I need to read.
[41:32] Look, it's right here. I'm sorry about my inability to read.
[41:41] You're talking to somebody who's dyslexic. So me and reading, majority of the time, just doesn't work well, so.
[41:50] Yeah. Okay.
[41:52] So I could just open this file, but at the moment what I'm going to do is I'm going to push this file into my Git repo, so that then you can have it, and we can alter it.
[42:03] You can open it on your end, and you can alter it to be how you like instead of how I like. And so I will -- all right.
[42:13] We always, just to be safe, we always do a git status, and we can see that the only modified and untracked file here is my Zshell RC, so that's good.
[42:29] So I'm going to git add my -- and I'm going to commit, and I will call this initial -- oops. So I accidentally -- yeah.
[42:53] >> Random question for streamers that are here, like, do you sit up straight when you're streaming?
[42:59] Like, I feel like I have better posture when I'm streaming, and I don't know why. But if I'm playing -- if I'm doing D&D -- no, I have horrible posture.
[43:09] I'm like laying -- practically laying down. They've taken pictures of funny faces I've made, but -- maybe I'll stand.
[43:22] I hardly ever use my standing desk. Do you stand?
[43:28] >> Yep. I never do.
[43:31] One of my legs is a little bit longer than the other, not that you can, like, see it looking at me.
[43:39] But it makes it uncomfortable to stand in one place. Like walking is fine, but standing in one place is not fine.
[43:46] So I use my standing desk with my under desk treadmill. But not while streaming or whatever, because then I'm, like, bouncing.
[43:59] I think I have a standing mat somewhere. I think it's in here.
[44:08] Let's find out. I will stop sharing.
[44:15] Okay. So here's my repo.
[44:24] I had a standing mat, and we will look for that next time. Okay.
[44:29] So... [ Humming ]
[44:31] And I'm really sad about -- because "Indiana Jones" was one of my all-time favorite shows growing up.
[44:50] Movies, like, all of them were my favorite. And just, like, looking back and going, "Damn, there was a lot of racism and classism in
[44:59] it." Yeah.
[45:01] Yep. I never saw those when I was a kid.
[45:06] So I saw them the first -- saw one the first time as an adult, and I couldn't stand it. I didn't actually see the whole thing.
[45:16] I was really sad about it, because I was, like, "I just wanted to see if I could download it a different way," but I...
[45:26] >> What different way? >> If I could just get the one file instead?
[45:32] >> Yes, you can. I know of at least two ways that you can do that.
[45:36] You can do it the Git way, if you want, or you can just open the file. So open the .ZSRC.
[45:45] Okay. And...
[45:47] >> I did that weird. Hold on.
[45:49] There we go. >> Cool.
[45:51] And then if you scroll back up a bit, and then you -- and next to "Go to File," there's the three-dot menu.
[46:01] Oh. Somewhere in here, there's a way that you can download...
[46:09] It's moved, I guess. Oh, yeah.
[46:12] Is it next to the pencil? No?
[46:15] >> No. I mean, I can just copy the text.
[46:24] >> Or you can clone the repo, whichever. I swear, there was a way that you could just download these.
[46:34] I mean, I'm sure that there still is, but it used to be easier. Oh.
[46:41] Yeah. Yeah.
[46:43] So... Yeah.
[46:45] That was me being like -- description, it's like -- it's fucking .files. And I didn't say "fucking .files," I said "eh .files."
[46:56] >> Okay. So I need to open the file to paste -- >> Okay.
[47:06] So I think maybe we need to be careful here, because now you have downloaded a file that potentially has the same name as your existing .zhrc.
[47:21] And it's not mad right now, because it's probably in your downloads folder. Oh, no, no, no.
[47:26] Never mind. Because you copied and pasted.
[47:28] >> Mm-hmm. That's a big read that I wanted to.
[47:30] >> Okay. Right, right, right.
[47:32] So never mind. All of that is fine.
[47:34] Proceed. My bad.
[47:36] >> I don't remember how to open a file in this. >> I mean, you can actually just go right back into your VS code and paste it into your
[47:48] -- >> Into the file? >> Yeah.
[47:52] The file that already exists. And I do it in replace of this.
[48:12] So I don't really know what Volta is for. >> Maybe users needs to be replaced.
[48:41] >> So right now it's searching for your name. Oh, I see what you're doing.
[48:46] Okay. So you're working on remembering how -- >> Now, some of these won't make any sense
[49:10] for you at all. Like the ones that are about, like, Anaconda, I don't know that you have Anaconda installed.
[49:21] And things like that. >> Well, we're gonna -- we're gonna -- I saved it.
[49:29] We're gonna do some things and stuff and see what happens when I restart this. >> Okay.
[49:38] Wish us luck, y'all. Because last time I really broke stuff.
[49:43] What are you saying now? >> So it's because I have stuff in mine that you don't have installed.
[49:57] >> Okay. Well, while I'm here, we can go to CD.
[50:05] We'll just do both. This one.
[50:08] And this. Maybe.
[50:10] Oh, it's here. Okay.
[50:12] Never mind. It's here.
[50:14] CD, this. >> Okay.
[50:16] >> How am I supposed to delete it if it doesn't exist? >> You know what, though?
[50:34] I'm gonna just go out on a limb and say you want the syntax highlighting. And so that better than deleting it would be to install it.
[50:45] >> For these, the Z profile things? >> Oh, well, like where it's saying down further.
[50:53] Where it's saying no such file or directory. >> Right.
[50:56] And I'm thinking, you know, I can do that one. But I want to get rid of these ones, too.
[51:03] >> But you probably if you're using Z shell, you probably want homebrew. >> Yeah, but I don't know why it's saying no such file or directory.
[51:14] >> But do you have homebrew? >> I should.
[51:18] So try typing brew space dash dash help. >> No.
[51:34] >> Okay. Okay.
[51:39] So you do. But yeah, all right.
[51:41] So let's just go let's just open my file backup in code. And we'll just remove the lines about those.
[51:50] And then deal with those another time. >> For yours, for the -- it's, like, really bugging me.
[52:05] >> Yeah, we're going to get rid of them. We're going to make it unbug.
[52:15] You restarted. And so it lost its ability to do the code command.
[52:24] Because we need to fix the file. >> Oh, okay.
[52:30] Okay, fine. Fine.
[52:42] Oh, it's right there. I'm so excited I can get rid of it.
[52:51] Or at least I can comment these things out. I don't know if I -- well, that didn't comment.
[52:56] >> Okay. So super cool trick in VS Code is if you highlight this whole thing, just select all.
[53:03] Okay. And now press command forward slash.
[53:09] >> Oh, yay. >> It will do -- it will comment out in whatever way makes sense for the type of file that it is.
[53:19] >> Oh, that's happiness. >> Yeah.
[53:22] >> Okay. Yay.
[53:24] And that was command forward slash. >> Yep.
[53:28] >> Sweet. Yay.
[53:30] This is truly happiness. >> Because -- and the way that it makes sense in my head that it's the forward slash is your first instinct was to type slash slash, I think.
[53:39] >> Yeah. >> Right?
[53:41] And so that's why it makes sense, I think, that it's the forward slash. >> That makes sense.
[53:47] >> Please comment this in whatever way makes sense. >> 77.
[53:52] 77. 77.
[53:57] So wouldn't I just want to go download all my zish? >> So let's just comment this one out as well for the moment.
[54:14] >> And then line 104. Should I do line 105, too?
[54:32] >> I don't think so. >> Is it upset about line 105?
[54:38] >> No. So I'll leave it.
[54:41] >> Okay. >> Line 123, 123, 125.
[54:58] Safe. >> Okay.
[55:00] >> I'm not closing closing. I'm saving.
[55:03] There we go. >> Okay.
[55:05] Have a look at line 75. >> Okay.
[55:10] >> So these are plug-ins that I have installed in my zishel. >> Okay.
[55:17] >> So I've got one for sublime text and there's GitHub and history and blah, blah, blah, but if you look to the right, if you scroll to the right, there is one for VS Code as well. And yeah.
[55:35] Okay. And so then -- and then if you look down -- well, one thing at a time, Laura, one thing at a time.
[55:43] Okay. So let's do your path thing through VS Code, the command palette.
[55:53] >> Oh. Yay.
[56:00] >> Okay. And so it just -- it says that it added it to your path.
[56:05] And so now I'm really curious about where that went. Because before it was not adding it to your zishel RC.
[56:17] And I think that that was the problem. Like why it was not getting -- like once you closed it, you didn't have it anymore.
[56:28] So looking for -- when it says that it added it to your path, the code command to your path, I'm really wondering which path that is. Okay.
[56:43] So let's just have a look. Let's save this.
[56:49] And then sort it. >> And restart this one?
[56:54] >> So that's actually -- it's like a shortcut. So go to your -- okay, type source and then tilde slash dot ZSHRC.
[57:19] Okay. And then that sort of like reloads the file without having to actually close your terminal.
[57:27] >> Okay. Let me quit this really quick.
[57:31] I'm going to do it one more time with VS code shut. >> Okay.
[57:38] >> Ah. Well, I think it worked.
[57:42] I think it did work. But --
[57:44] >> Okay. Let's try closing your terminal 2 just to see if it still works after restarting your terminal.
[57:52] Because I'm not sure whether the path is correct yet. But it got rid of all those stupid things that showed up.
[57:59] >> Yes. >> Yeah.
[58:01] >> Yeah. So it's definitely progress.
[58:06] Oh, and this is the next thing that we're going to look at are the aliases. >> It worked.
[58:15] >> I fixed it. We fixed it.
[58:18] We fixed it. >> Yay.
[58:22] >> That was really annoying that it wasn't working for so long. >> Oh, I remember the pain.
[58:28] Yeah. >> All right.
[58:30] Yay. >> Now for some more magic.
[58:34] >> Does anybody know how to do shout outs in Twitch? I need to give Laura a shout out.
[58:41] I don't know how to. >> I'm good.
[58:44] I mean, we just chatted it. Like with our vocal cords.
[58:51] >> I know, but I want to learn. I don't know if this is going to do it, but I'm going to -- what's this do?
[59:05] Eh, that didn't do anything. All right.
[59:08] Anyway, moving on. >> Oh, maybe it's like S/O.
[59:14] I don't know. Or S/O.
[59:17] I actually have no idea. But anyway.
[59:23] >> Oh, it's because you're not in this chat. I can't shout it out.
[59:27] >> Okay. >> I didn't realize people had to be here for it.
[59:31] >> So scroll down to the bottom of this file because we have some other things that we need to get rid of because they don't make sense for you. Like these ones that are about suborbital, those are about the place that I work.
[59:42] And so you don't need those. Okay.
[59:57] >> Yeah. And then this one.
[59:59] >> 144. >> Okay.
[60:03] >> Okay. So if you look at line 143.
[60:09] >> Okay. >> See how it says -- so alias means sort of like if a person has an alias, then it's like another name that they go by, right?
[60:23] Does that ring true? >> Yes.
[60:26] >> Okay. >> So sorry.
[60:34] With everything going on, I got super distracted of Ramon saying are we a fan of oh my Z shell here and homie got the shout out to work. >> Thank you.
[60:48] >> So I just wanted to say that. They got it figured out.
[60:52] I'm a fan. And I'm going to turn Jen into a potential oh my Z shell fan.
[60:59] Okay. So if you look at line 143.
[61:03] >> Okay. >> So what we're saying here is that we're going to create an alias.
[61:08] The dash G means global. So it means that this alias works wherever we are.
[61:13] It's not like directory specific. Okay.
[61:18] And the alias is Z. So Z equals that string.
[61:22] And so what it's saying is when I type Z, you need to read it as this string. So remember if you look in your terminal, where -- okay.
[61:34] So we can fix that in a second. >> Clicky clicky.
[61:39] I know. >> And when you were -- when you were opening the ZSHRC file, you had to type out like tilde forward slash and then ZSHRC.
[61:57] Remember that? Okay.
[62:01] So what that alias says is I can just type Z and you know it means all the rest of that crap. So try it now.
[62:08] Close that file in code. >> I'm going to copy and paste these really quick just so that way -- oh, I'll just screenshot them.
[62:20] Screenshot. There.
[62:27] Now I have it. >> Well, you have it as well because it's, you know, it's living on your machine.
[62:32] >> I know, so that way I can see it without having VS code open. Like a notepad.
[62:40] >> I can -- okay. Sure.
[62:44] >> Kind of thing. Okay.
[62:48] So I close that and now try the same thing. >> Try code space Z.
[62:59] And you got it without having to type tilde forward slash ZSH with a dot. I missed one.
[63:08] I missed a character. So it's just that much tidier.
[63:12] >> Oh, nice. Oh, we deleted these.
[63:16] >> Didn't save maybe. >> Delete.
[63:20] Delete. Save.
[63:26] Now I'm going to try it again because I'm pretty sure I saved it this time. All right.
[63:43] Dope. >> Yay.
[63:47] >> So I noticed that when you were -- when you wanted to test the code command, you always -- you were CDing into, like, desktop something something? >> Mm-hmm.
[63:59] >> Okay. >> I can do it for this.
[64:03] >> Yes. >> Okay.
[64:07] Let's do -- I want to do C. I'm going to do it as --
[64:24] >> What was it? It was desktop?
[64:28] >> It's desktop forward slash code. Because I just don't know, like, which one I want.
[64:34] But do I need a CD before that? >> No.
[64:38] You're still going to type the CD. >> Okay.
[64:42] >> So I'm going to do it that way. It's up to you.
[64:47] >> Would it -- where would it be? >> Actually, you don't need to, even.
[64:54] Because the -- it'll imply the -- or it'll infer the CD. So let's just set up your directory.
[65:06] >> So that's -- that's where your code stuff lives? >> Yes.
[65:11] >> Okay. Cool.
[65:15] So save this file. >> Okay.
[65:19] >> And then go back to your terminal. >> Okay.
[65:23] >> Type the word "source" and then space and then Z, because we're going to source -- we're going to reload that Z file again. Z, not C?
[65:31] Okay. So now type just C and then enter.
[65:40] Oh, permission denied. Why is that?
[65:49] >> I ran into this a bit when Anthony and I were troubleshooting it, too. This was a very, very long time ago.
[65:58] >> Oh, thanks for joining us, Ramon. >> See you later, Ramon.
[66:02] >> See you tomorrow. Ramon and I work together, for folks who don't know.
[66:09] >> So I -- >> So let's search for it.
[66:22] Let's just copy and paste the -- just copy and paste the zish colon permission denied. And let's just see what we find.
[66:34] >> The Google-nator. Google-nator.
[66:45] >> I think it's going to be -- I saw something, like a snippet that looked like it was going to say that you need to just give your terminal permissions. No, sorry, that's the right link.
[66:54] I think that's -- there's going to be a section entitled something about give your terminal. So go down.
[67:03] >> Make it bigger. >> Might have been the last one.
[67:07] Is blah, blah. Keep going.
[67:16] Keep going. Keep going.
[67:23] Okay. Ah.
[67:39] I don't know why my computer says staff, but that works. Okay.
[67:50] Scroll down, maybe. Yeah, we're not trying to work on a particular file.
[67:57] So I think that there's another section after this one in the webpage that's maybe more what we're looking for. Keep going.
[68:10] So -- hold on. Okay.
[68:41] I think that's it. >> Yeah, I think that's it.
[68:45] >> I think that's it. >> Okay.
[68:49] >> Thank you for sharing. >> Thank you.
[68:53] And I should have read and write. >> But if you look at where it says staff, it says read only.
[68:57] >> All right. >> Because I think what you were noticing was that it's like staff was associated or maybe you're in a staff or something.
[69:01] I don't remember. >> Yeah.
[69:05] I don't know why. >> Okay.
[69:09] Refreshy-freshy. >> So it's not going to hurt anything at all to do the source Z, but we didn't actually modify anything in that Z shell RC file this time.
[69:23] And so it doesn't really do anything to reload the page because that file hasn't actually changed. >> Wouldn't we have just changed the permissions, though?
[69:32] >> But those don't live in the Z SHRC file. Because what I was trying to do is make it so that way it was for everything.
[69:42] So you're saying that it needs to do -- okay. >> I think I'm not.
[69:50] I'm saying that we don't need to -- like the Z file is just not involved at the moment. >> Okay.
[69:58] >> Okay. Yeah.
[70:02] So Homie says I think staff is the default group on macOS. I think that's true, too.
[70:08] Okay. So --
[70:12] >> Core shell. >> Oh.
[70:16] Let's not do that. Because that's a whole different shell.
[70:20] Okay. So they're trying to sell us their thing, and we don't want their thing.
[70:30] Okay. >> I like how we both paused.
[70:43] >> Oh, I think we maybe both hit show at the same time, and so one of us showed and the other hid. Yeah, so that is handy.
[70:59] I don't think it's going to help this problem, because that's -- that'll show, like, what's in the dot files directory. But what we need to fix is this permissions problem.
[71:11] And I don't think that the permissions necessarily live -- well, I mean, I guess they could do. But -- yeah.
[71:23] Okay. So -- okay.
[71:27] So you can CD. So just try CDing into your desktop.
[71:33] Slash code. >> Just going back to the beginning to make sure.
[71:54] >> Okay. So that's interesting.
[71:58] So you can CD into it directly, but you can't do it with an alias? >> I think it's because of the users, and the users have to --
[72:05] >> Yeah. >> Hold on.
[72:10] System settings are actually -- we want -- >> Yeah.
[72:16] >> We want to make sure that -- and I need to -- because it will give you the option to add the -- that's not what I wanted, either. To add the actual computer here, not just the home folder.
[72:39] Go up to view in your -- yeah. And show view options.
[72:55] Show library folder. I think is what you're looking for.
[73:03] Oh, no. Oh, yeah.
[73:10] I don't remember. I had to fix this problem, too, and I don't remember.
[73:16] Okay. I'm going to go back here really quick.
[73:57] And now let's go to get info. And you have reaved right.
[74:02] >> Yeah, it did. >> Oh, okay.
[74:07] It was maybe covered by the comment -- or the shown thing. >> Wow.
[74:16] This one is read only. >> Okay.
[74:20] >> So let's change this to read and write. What?
[74:26] >> That's for admin. >> I have admin.
[74:33] >> But, yeah, it's not going to help the stuff thing, though. Okay.
[74:44] You know what? In our last few minutes, I want to back burner this, if you don't mind.
[74:51] And maybe I can stay on. Because I actually -- my company takes the last Monday of every month off.
[75:00] >> Nice. >> Oh, no, I can't stay late because I have a meeting with somebody else.
[75:04] That's right. >> That's okay.
[75:06] >> We can work on this part another time. I wanted to show you a few other things that are in the Z shell RC file that make life nice.
[75:15] >> I'm not going to lie. I'm so hyper fixated on this.
[75:19] >> We can do that another time. >> It's just not going to sink in because I'm going to be like, but I got to figure out this problem.
[75:28] I don't know if anybody else has that. It's really annoying.
[75:32] It's really annoying when you get hyper fixated on something and you're like, I want to think about other things and talk about other things. But when it doesn't.
[75:42] So -- but I think that's where we should start next time. Because I really like the aliases.
[75:52] That was fun. >> And so you can see the other aliases that I have.
[76:00] Like I have some get ones. I actually just added those yesterday.
[76:04] For some things that like get, check out, main, like the ones that I type the most frequently. So now like that I can -- I've just aliased as GM.
[76:16] So I can just GM. But I did not alias things that could fuck shit up.
[76:21] So I did not alias push, for instance. Like get push.
[76:25] >> Okay. >> Things like that.
[76:29] Because I'm not that brave. Because I'll fuck shit up.
[76:39] >> I'm totally looking at one of these things again. And it's weird because I used to do this when I worked at media temple for server stuff.
[76:51] Long, long time ago. And I think that's why it's also driving me so insane.
[76:57] So why don't I know what it is? >> Mm-hmm.
[77:01] >> So I think that's the other very, very annoying part of it. So this is what I'm going to be doing for the next -- I'll get it fixed.
[77:14] Not brave enough to walk away. Whichever one happens first.
[77:18] I'm going to send you a link to a blog post of mine where I said -- oh, I'm hearing stuff. I made a list of my favorite tech resources.
[77:36] I think I maybe also linked this last week. But it has some of my -- oh, here it is.
[77:43] I'll just link you directly to this. This is an article with lots of information about optimizing your terminal experience.
[77:57] Here we go. >> Yay.
[78:00] Thank you. >> So we could do this next time.
[78:03] >> Okay. >> And I'm going to be setting up my position syntax highlighting and all that stuff.
[78:15] >> Could you send this in the private chat, too, please? >> Mm-hmm.
[78:19] >> Oh, wait, wait, wait. No.
[78:21] It just took a minute. I don't know why it wasn't showing up for me.
[78:24] I got it now. Thank you.
[78:26] >> Mm-hmm. >> Yay.
[78:28] Well, thank you for co-hosting with me once again. >> Yes, thank you.
[78:32] >> I know I'm not the best even when I get really, really frustrated. And all I want to do is figure this out now.
[78:40] It's sometimes really fun and really annoying. And once again --
[78:46] >> We're all mad here. >> Yes.
[78:48] Yes. And thank you again, everyone, who has shared that I'm looking for a job.
[78:53] I greatly, greatly appreciate it. And we will be back actually on Friday to do Python.
[79:00] So see you Friday and see everyone tomorrow for TypeScript. It's going to be fun.
[79:06] >> Yes. >> All right.
[79:08] Bye, Laura. >> Bye.
[79:10] >> Thank you. Oh, I got to raid us.
[79:12] Let's raid. Let's raid.
[79:14] I got to find somebody to raid, too. Y'all, this always gets me really distracted.
[79:19] It's because I'm like, I got to raid. Who do we raid to?
[79:23] We got to find somebody alive. This person looks cool.
[79:33] We'll raid to them. Raid Laura.
[79:43] I'm pretty sure she's ending her stream here soon, too. >> Pretty sure, yes.
[79:48] >> That could be fun, though. That could be fun.
[79:52] All right. And -- okie dokie.
[79:59] So -- oh. I can't raid to them, either?
[80:03] That's dumb. Okay.
[80:06] This is me learning and not anything against anyone. I just -- it's kind of just frustrating when I can't.
[80:14] And I really want to. All right.
[80:17] You guys aren't getting raided today. It's just not going to happen.
[80:20] All right. Bye-bye!
