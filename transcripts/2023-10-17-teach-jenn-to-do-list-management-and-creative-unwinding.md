[00:00] Welcome to another episode of Teach Gen Tech and today is come hang out with me because well, I have a lot of shit to do. I have like 45 minutes to do it and yeah,
[00:14] it's Tuesday. So I wanted to hang out with you and I need to figure out everything I'm doing. On my list today is last week, Roy helped me start my amazing to-do list. And that being said,
[00:37] I have to write down a lot of these processes that I'm super stuck on. But also, instead of actually getting started on this yesterday, I decided it would be really fun to rearrange my
[00:48] office or living room. It's kind of both. So I'm in the front room. We have like a weird double living room type of situation. So I set up my office in the front room and it used to be like
[01:05] one little cube of it and it very separated. Now I'm just taking up the entire thing and we have light in the background. I have some books that I apparently cover up. And yeah, this is basically,
[01:18] I need to figure out my camera because I am setting it behind my computer now, instead of like behind my monitors, like on its own tripod instead of on the tripod on my desk.
[01:30] That being said, I need to actually download the app for it. So that is what I'm working on first. What up, Jason? And thanks for the reminder to actually stream today. I'm on holiday right now
[01:46] or vacation. I'm so not used to... And I found out late last week and I'm so grateful I am because it's just been... It's so weird just having something that's been on my mind just makes
[02:06] it really heavy. And then I kept thinking about it and stressing it out. And now I'm like, oh, I don't have that one thing to deal with. And it's like, I love what I do. So it was very, very weird
[02:15] to be okay with not doing anything and just working on everything else, including I finished up. Let's see if you guys can see it. This lovely desk thing here. Move my mic. Don't kill the water.
[02:33] I got that desk tri... TV stand thing. It was supposed to be a TV stand. It's been in the garage for months and I finally got it to be good enough to work on and use. And it's green now and
[02:51] it's pretty. Oh no. We'll see you in a minute, Jason. I will be sitting here working on the app for my camera and then my to-do list, however far I can get today because I need to get things done.
[03:08] And I'm surprised I'm actually streaming on time today. So handy dandy camera. Yay. I did figure out that... Oh, maybe it's not that. Maybe it's something else.
[03:29] Or it just times out. What up, Zero? How's it going? I have my camera. It's on. Oh, it is. I think it is that. It randomly... I don't know if y'all have ever seen a stream of mine where my
[03:47] camera just blacks out. And I'm like, I don't know if OBS is just trying to take over because it happens across any platform that I have or if it's something with my camera. But because of where
[03:58] the setup is now, I need to actually use my phone and set it up. Yeah, it's a Sony. It is a Sony ZV-E10. So that is my first to-do list thing is to download the app so I can actually put it to
[04:17] where it's supposed to go. Because right now I am using the computers, my MacBook Pro's camera, which I got to say, the M1s, I think this was a 2020, actually not that bad. The camera's not bad.
[04:33] So let's Google. Let's do some Googling. Y'all can go on my Google adventure with me of the randomness of how I figure out how to do things.
[04:46] Oh, yeah. I feel like I should know. What up, Alex? I should know more about cameras. But I don't know the differences enough. I used to work at a production company. You would think
[05:05] that I would know more about cameras, but it is the one side of tech that does not click for me. It never has. What up? We got a party going on today, y'all.
[05:23] What up, Renee? Renee, I just realized, I think a week ago, that I wasn't following you back on Twitter. I was like, "What is wrong with me?" I know who you are. I thought I was.
[05:36] Oh, Jason, I forgot. That's one of the reasons why I was like, "We need to be friends," is because you were in film beforehand. So I feel like you shouldn't tell people that,
[05:48] because now I'm going to be like, "Yo, tell me how to do the things." But I also do that with my videographer friends here and photography friends here, because
[05:59] I interned as a videographer here. So like here in Phoenix, now that I'm back in Phoenix. So all my friends that know how to do the things live here. So I have fun with that.
[06:12] And I also need to be paying... Oh, I do have a Discord message. Not Discord. What's that message? Okay. I have a friend coming to help me move stuff today, because I'm going to go pick up a new TV
[06:29] stand and a dresser, and I'm renting a van, and I'm very excited about it. And I'm like, "Okay, cool. People can help me load the dresser and stuff into the van. Got it. Cool."
[06:41] And I didn't think about doing it from at my house and how to unload them. So I have a friend coming to help, hopefully. And what up, Anthony? What are you flying? Can you actually... Is it
[06:59] letting you see the stream? And tell Jen, "Hi." Are you guys coming back from your honeymoon? I loved her pictures. I've been loving all her pictures.
[07:10] It looks like you guys had so much fun. Okay. Reply. Okey-dokey. I'm not great at multitasking. I don't know if anybody else knows.
[07:29] What up, Jacob? Jacob, actually, this is going to be the time I don't get to say all nice things about Jacob today. It is all nice things about Roy, because Roy helped me figure out my getting
[07:46] started on my to-do list, because y'all, I am not great on... No, I didn't post a stream on Twitter. I could post a stream on Twitter. Jacob, will you post a stream on Twitter? Tag me so I can retweet
[08:00] it. Because this is my last minute I need to get shit done hangout session, because I forgot that I was supposed to stream today. And then Jason was like, "Yo, somebody post it so I can retweet
[08:13] it, please." Then, plus, it looks cooler when you guys do it than when I do it, because then people are like, "Oh, somebody else is there. I want to go hang out." I'm slowly going to get my followers
[08:27] and stuff up. It's going to happen. I'm going to get consistent. Roy has been helping me, even though I didn't do my to-do list yesterday, because, Jacob, you guys were talking about gaming
[08:38] on our Discord. I was like, "Sweet. I can go co-work while they're gaming." For some reason... Oh. Oh. That's kind of cool.
[08:53] But if I stream to Twitter, they can't be in the chat, because I don't like using OBS. I am lazy, and I use Streamletter. It is very lazy. Maybe I will put that on the giant to-do list.
[09:15] You're on your way. Okay. I'm live streaming. I'm not living. I'm live streaming. Yes, this is what happens. If you ever meet me in person, I will
[09:31] talk to my text out loud. It's going to be great. It'll be fine. Leave to go. Pick up the van. Okay. There we go. There. Yeah. But yes, I have rearranged the
[09:51] entire behind the scenes. Do you all think this is a weird layout, though? I feel like it's weird if it's the front door. That's the only thing I think that is weird about this layout. You can't
[10:03] really see my really cool thing that I made. I don't know. Whatever. It works. Camera. And share my screen so you guys can go through the Googles with me. I wish you luck.
[10:26] Share screen. Share. Yay. Okay. Oh. How to paint a bike. Y'all, I got a bike yesterday. I barely know how to ride a bike. I'm very excited about it and very nervous about it, too.
[10:50] We went to go buy it yesterday, and I was very, very wobbly about it. I didn't want to ride it at all, but it works, and it was a good price. I just hate the color of it. I am going to see
[11:07] if I can paint it. Oh, that's what I was thinking, and that's why I'm trying to fix this camera. Well, I need to fix it anyway. It's not broken. I just need to get it working so that way I can
[11:26] crop it better because that's what it does. Oh, Jacob, you're the bestest. Thank you. Um, yeah, I mean, I could do that. Um, I want to do green.
[11:52] Wait, somebody, I realize, thank you, Jacob, this is really smart. Somebody commented on this that I apparently never replied.
[12:09] Let's go put this in this channel, this window. That's a great idea. I should have thought of that, Jacob. Thank you. But, um, like, that's just weird.
[12:24] Okay, let me see if I can find, no, we got to focus. Camera, camera, camera. I'm going to say it like a gazillion times so I remember camera. Um, oh, that's good. Maybe that's why I didn't
[12:43] reply to it. And I'm still surprised that Anthony can kind of sort of see part of the stream or it kicks him off from the plane. Picking up the TV stand. Okay, here we go. Oh.
[13:19] Yay. I'm glad Italy was dope. That's so exciting. Okay, camera. Stop replying to people, Jen. Camera, camera, camera, camera. Because this is the first part. Because to do streaming,
[13:32] you have to have a good frame. Okay, ZV-E10. Um, iPhone control. That's what we're going to go with. iOS app. Oh, I saw it. iOS app.
[13:51] Jacob, I missed you on the stream the other day, but I did a really bad job. Like, it was very sad. For those who don't know, we stream on Sundays, The Expanse. It's super fun.
[14:16] Um, yeah. You should join. You should come hang out with us. Oh, that does remind me. I need to, Jacob, can you, like, follow me back, uh, on the, the OSRG Twitter?
[14:33] Ooh, that's exciting. Who all is doing that with y'all? For the D&D? Is it D&D? Is it? I like being able to, like, tune into other people when I don't know what's going on,
[14:51] to learn from them. The experts are too expert-y. Yes, that's, that's a word. I'm going with it. Okay. Imaging Edge. Functionally useless. Okay, that's cool.
[15:14] What is Imaging Edge Mobile? Let's look at this, because I don't know what it is. Doo doo doo. I could also make this bigger. Except I'll do, do, do, do, and zoom. Zoom.
[15:45] Instant transfer via Wi-Fi. Enable cameras to mobile device. You can install it. Oh, okay. So, yes, it can do the zoom. Oh, yay, it's your old crew. That is exciting.
[16:02] Yeah, or is it Hector DMing? Because didn't he used to DM that one when you guys did it? Okay. We need to do these. Do these. I think it's also, like, this cable that I'm using. I
[16:28] don't know. It's a battery pack for it, and I feel like it's, like, somewhat loose. So. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo. And we will go do this. And this.
[16:52] Go download the app. Do any of you ever use your phone to?
[17:08] I wasn't planning on it. I'm setting up my camera to control it, because I'm not going to be able to touch my camera as easily and, like, adjust it so it's in the right frame.
[17:21] I don't know. I could use my phone, but I have a camera that has better than my phone. I have my iPad, but I use my iPad during streams, too. Yes, I have an iPhone.
[17:46] Oh! What is Inktober? You heard Ryan on a pod rocket? Which one?
[18:15] Where are you posting these drawings? Can you post them in our Discord? I am not a drawer whatsoever, but I like to admire other people's drawings and artwork.
[18:31] Edgemoble. Git. Look at my face. Okay. Do it. Post them. That would be amazing. Okay. Close out this. Work on this.
[19:00] I'm getting there. We're going to see if we can start controlling it. Agree. I did. Okay. I agree. I think I made an account for it. We're going to find out. This is the boring part of streams.
[19:23] Dot com. Oh, Jacob. So, I was thinking, should we do, like, a two-part Clerk one? Or, dude, should we have you and Roy on at the same time? That could be really cool.
[19:52] Or, like, when do you think you're going to be ready to do it? What do you mean you don't know? Sure. Like, how would you say teaching it to people would be?
[20:14] I will say using doing Theo's T3, like, chirp app. That was a pretty cool way of seeing what Clerk does. And then using it for our Discord. Or for the Expanse is really cool, too.
[20:35] You just sent me a code and then this app is janky. Oh, my gosh. It's Laura. What up, Laura?
[21:09] Laura, I'm starting to get our as I get really distracted and working on other things that I'm not supposed to be working on. Let's go here. Hey, look, y'all. We're actually getting, like,
[21:26] likes and stuff. And views. Like, it skyrocketed the last two. Very excited about this. This is gonna be great. But I wanted to show you, Laura, because you're here. Playlist. Wait for it.
[21:46] Learning Python with Laura. It's getting there. All the videos so far are gonna be there. And then I still I should still have the do I not have them anymore? Or am I decided to redo them?
[22:10] For MISC Mondays. I thought I had them on here. Am I just, like, not seeing it? Okay. JavaScript. Astro. Why can I not see these?
[22:36] Oh, it's right there. Wow. Took me a minute. Yay. I don't think I have them all on this playlist yet, but I will. What do you mean my code's invalid, bro? I'm gonna get this set up. It's gonna happen.
[23:01] Oh, yeah. Alex, are you thinking about, like, rebuilding your site for the blogs and stuff? Yeah. That would be so cool. I find it fascinating. Terrifying. But fascinating.
[23:31] Yes, you guys can see my oh, yay, I did. I'm getting better at this. You can't see my verification code. Yay. Put it in the right one. Log in.
[23:50] Oh. I mean. I guess I'm gonna say that. What do I do? What do I do? There's a lot of options over here, y'all. Sorry, it's, like,
[24:23] totally taking me a minute to blog. There we go. Okay. Okay. Allow. Allow while using. Confer camera model name. I feel like this is not on here. So, let's do this. I guess I could share
[24:46] my screen, too. Pretty sure I can do that. Let's see. Yeah, that's what I'm working on right now, is the Sony app. But let me see if this cable will work on here to share. Give me a second.
[25:14] Maybe. Y'all don't need to see all the annoying notifications.
[25:35] And. Why it goes to that one, I don't know.
[25:57] Oh, yay. There. We will do this. It will be fun. Close this one. And close this one. Oh, and it's doing updates. That's cool. Oh, no. I closed it. There we go.
[26:20] Do, do, do, do, do. And stop screen. Share screen. Share screen. Share entire screen, because this is a giant screen. Share. Hey, it's my iPhone.
[26:48] You guys can see what apps I use. It's fine. It's not that exciting. Okay. Yay. Thank you for the follow. More models than above. Okay.
[27:09] Camera registration. This is, you know, this is complicated. Yeah, I don't know why it keeps turning off. This is new. I don't know what I did to it.
[27:22] That's okay. We will figure that out. First, we will read the screen. Um.
[27:33] Wi-Fi function. Maybe. Yeah, I wish I could say this one.
[27:55] I will say it solidly matters what your question is. And please ask appropriate questions for stream. That is something I've had to learn to ask people.
[28:06] And if I don't know and it's a normal question, someone here probably can. Smartphone connect. Wi-Fi standby. Oh, QR code. Yay.
[28:34] Okay. Okay. Yay. I feel like we are getting there. Remote shooting. Okay. Oh, wait. What?
[29:05] What did it say that I apparently did not pay enough attention to? Let's see. Why? Why are you disconnected? Camera off. Okay. Let me use Bluetooth.
[29:32] I will figure out how to turn Bluetooth on on this thing. Rude. Um, this operation or setting is not available as follows.
[29:50] That's not nice. Oh, you got to turn the Bluetooth function on. How to pattern recognize when I try to solve
[30:08] hackering Java or a DSA questions. The question feels unclear to me. And I'm struggling to understand or apply which function.
[30:19] Do you have an example or a bit more information on that? Valorant. Okay. Or anybody else have, like, follow-up questions on that?
[30:47] Oh, thank you, Alex. Okay. Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[31:12] Menu. Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do. Oh, that's a great reply, Alex. If it's for interview screening.
[31:59] Pairing. Pairing. I know I have a bunch of random. Oh, this one can go away. They decided to go to Bermuda without me. I just want to forget the device.
[32:21] Forget device. Oh, this is a great conversation you guys are having. Pattern recognition. Do you think this is something that we could try to do on stream
[32:59] that would be helpful for everyone? Because, like, even if I don't know how to do it, I can totally see if we could get a, like, a guest on to see if they could help out with it.
[33:31] Why? Need to write the question down and break it into parts to determine how to come up with a solution. Ooh. Okay. That's just, like, my life in general. I'm not great at breaking down
[33:50] questions. Or, like, a to-do list. As to me asking Roy for help on a lot of this stuff. Is it something that we could break down one together? Would that be helpful? Oh, geez.
[34:18] You connected. Why are you not connecting now? I'm in your bag. I would definitely be willing to do it if it's something that we think that we
[34:50] could do together. And yeah. Robin, that's what I was reading, too. And that's totally I think that's something that comes up in so many situations of not being able to break down
[35:11] a word problem. Because knowing where to start and figure it out is, like, such a difficult thing to do. Of, like, just figuring out where to start.
[35:24] Yes to Laura. Because, well, Laura knows this all too well. Laura is the one who taught me how to, like, start breaking this stuff down. Which is really weird that we haven't talked in so long,
[35:40] Laura. Input password. I am slowly getting my camera connected to Wi-Fi. We're making progress. Yay.
[36:08] Time. 90.
[36:29] Oh! Yes to Joel. And Accelidraw is amazing. It's something that I'm cool sharing this. Is it's I know I'm let's see if I can zoom this in while
[36:53] holding the camera. So is it can help having somebody ask you questions of what you want to do to figure it out. Because, like, this is something that I've clearly been working on since July.
[37:10] That's cool. Of, like, what do I want out of my website? And this one's a racer. But Accelidraw does it, too. There's a couple different types of just being able to break it down on, like,
[37:23] what you want it to look like. Or what you think the problem is. And do it step by step this way. There's also I don't know if I can zoom. Accelidraw. There we go.
[37:44] Library. We should have a library. No. I'm not logged in. Maybe. Maybe. Even. Nope.
[37:56] Please be my friend. I would like to log in. And I don't see where to log in. Help. No. Log in. Log in. Log in. I would like to log in.
[38:19] How about just log in? Okay. I'm getting really distracted from this. But a lot of the streams have been done that we've done have been I can do it this way. Let me.
[38:38] I don't know. I always have a hard time logging into Accelidraw to get to old things. So, that's a big reason that I don't use it as often. Reasonability. Hopefully, I wasn't looking at a
[38:53] bad note in the past. Okay. We're good. I wasn't looking at anything really awkward. Let's move this one. So, you guys can see it. Oh, wow. Bro. That is not what I wanted.
[39:11] Okay. So, on this is Notability. I use it on my iPad, but I have access to it on my phone. But if I go to Teach Gen Tech. And we can go to I took notes on Roy's.
[39:39] But like I've had to when somebody's teaching me something or I am learning something, I have to break it down by seeing a visual version of it. And a lot of times this is
[39:54] something that Laura and I talked about too of when taking a problem down and breaking it down to practice it. This is something that I have found very, very useful.
[40:05] I hope that kind of gives you an idea. Yeah. Laura is like the best, y'all. Go follow Laura wherever Laura's currently active. Which I think is Mastodon. And LinkedIn.
[40:23] Why did you turn off again? Dude. Bro. Camera. We're gonna figure this out, y'all. We will get it. I think it keeps let's see if I can show you
[40:39] guys. So, since it's for streaming, I use the like plugin cable and it doesn't shut all the way. And I think it gets loose and keeps turning itself off. I wonder if I have a charged battery.
[40:55] We're gonna go look for that now. So, I won't be able to reply. I can I would be able to hear you guys if you were like, you know, if I could hear things. But I can't read text that far. But you
[41:09] guys are gonna see I'll move this really quick. What is behind these very, very messy like they look so nice right now. These lovely drawers. Like, look how pretty that is. I'm very proud of
[41:28] it. And then you are gonna see what it looks like underneath. Because I want to look for a battery. Please stand by.
[41:45] So, So,
[42:28] all right. Thank you. Thank you. It's the I got it and I was like, I'm gonna redo this and make it like a dark cherry wood. Because that's
[42:43] what our cherry stain. Because that's what our other stuff is. And then I found out that the top of it is laminate. Doesn't work. So, I started taking laminate off and created a giant gouge.
[42:57] I was gonna give up and then slowly figured out how to fill it. And then it also, you know, I got all the way done. About to put the doors back on. And I realized it sags. Like, I don't
[43:10] know if you guys can tell. It's supposed to have three doors. But it, like, sags really bad down in the middle. So, I couldn't put the doors back on. And I was like, you know what? I'm just not
[43:20] gonna use it. And but using it as a background works. Because normally I won't be trying to do that on stream. Let's see if there's battery. I don't think I've charged these in forever. So,
[43:36] I don't think these are. Oh, hey. And how much battery do we have on this? We got eight percent. We have a little bit. See if we have eight percent enough to get this figured out.
[43:56] Or if it will charge. I don't think this will charge it. But, you know, we can find out. This may charge it, though.
[44:07] Thank you all. And it, you know, also doing this stuff with y'all on stream is making me learn my camera. Which is helpful. You're charging. It's charging. Yay. And not with the battery pack.
[44:30] This is exciting. We have progress. Okay. I would really like to connect this now. Wi-Fi settings. Did that help with everybody's comments?
[44:46] Oh, I used to have a Lumix. That was one of the first cameras. Actually, a friend of mine, when I got into videography, was like, yo, I have this camera. Do you want to try it?
[45:03] And I was like, yeah. And I never learned it. But I had it for a while. And what up, Mark? Okay. I'm going to get it logged in. And it's not restarting. So, I feel like we're
[45:26] going in a good direction. Oh, yeah. Like, I love that we're getting way more 4K cameras that are accessible.
[45:44] Valorant, I think it was before you joined. We were talking about that. Also, iPhones being really good streaming cameras, too.
[46:01] I'm really glad that I used to have a old school phone. Because to be able to enter in the Wi-Fi password, it's like, what do they call
[46:19] this? The triple key? Multi key? When you have to hit them so many times to be able to hit. Texting used to take so long.
[46:34] I'm going to get this password in there. It's going to be done. It's connecting. It is connecting. Yay. Okay. We have that connected.
[47:13] Which for some reason, I'm curious if it will help with Bluetooth. They're different. I know they're different. But if they help each other. Pairing. Perform pairing from device to be
[47:31] connected. Perform pairing from a supported application if connecting to a smartphone. Okay. This is going to happen. Settings. I don't think we need that.
[47:56] This is the part of tech that I don't talk about on here often. But phones have never been my or cameras have never been my best friend. That's not what I wanted.
[48:21] Okay. It's scanning. Maybe it'll set Bluetooth function on the camera menu to on. Also set one of the following functions to on. Okay. I will do that. It's going to happen.
[49:05] A remote. Bluetooth remote power setting on. All on? No. Okay. That didn't help me.
[49:29] I hope y'all got your tech figured out better than this. Bluetooth function is on.
[49:49] Why won't you work? Please be my friend. Maybe.
[50:03] Oh. Connection. Okay. That's not what I wanted.
[50:24] Oh, my goodness. Are y'all up to doing anything fun right now than hanging out with me, fighting, getting these paired?
[50:47] Pairing. I feel like we might have some progress. Okay. Okay. Pair.
[51:10] Pairing complete. Okay. Oh, yay. Ah. Well, I'm glad that you're this is helping. I am happy to be the random distractions of trying
[51:35] to get this to work. Start. Before proceeding, first make setting on your camera to connect and operate to a smartphone. It's on. It is on. Join.
[51:51] Why? I just want this to work. Send to smartphone. Control with smartphone. Yes. Yes. Okay. Send. Whatever.
[52:13] Is your call your first interview or, like, have you already interviewed with them? Connection. Start. Okay.
[52:36] Join. Maybe. Maybe we could get news. Eh? Remote shooting. Okay. We got here before. I feel like we're doing good.
[53:01] We'll try it. My hands. So many cables. So many cables. Well, that's not great.
[53:16] That is an amazing angle. Thank you, self. I appreciate it. I don't feel like trying to put you where you're supposed to go, though.
[53:28] Wee. Okay. It is on a tissue box. Very lovely tissue box. That's not great. Why? Why can we not have good angles today?
[53:45] Okay. The old handy dandy tripod that I had. It will help. Well, this isn't the normal one. Where'd the normal one go? Maybe this is. I don't know.
[53:59] There. Uh-huh. And. Oh, y'all, I thought I was still sharing the screen, and I wasn't. Y'all are probably like,
[54:17] what the hell is she doing? I don't know. At least you guys didn't see all the really bad angles. I will say that. We've got that going for us. Okay. And.
[54:30] Shoe. Can it zoom in?
[54:52] Doop, doop. Well, that's kind of fun. Hey, we got connected. Oh, it took a second. All right. Let's turn back this way. No, we're still upside down.
[55:10] One more. One more. Hey, we are connected, y'all. We got it connected. Alex, do we need to tell anybody how cool you are?
[55:24] Like, can we do that? Be like, look, hire Alex because he's super dope. What do I call a person who is struggling to make friends? I don't know. A human?
[55:48] Because all of us kind of struggle with making friends. But, okay, on a serious note. We are going to create a clip really quick. Hi, everybody. For whoever needs to know,
[56:12] Alex is super, super dope and would love working with you. So, please hire Alex because we want him to keep being our friend and be happy. And he's really good at what he does.
[56:21] So, hire Alex. Thank you. There you go, Alex. You have a clip. I'm leaving it to you to figure out how to clip it, though. Because, yeah, we'll get there. We will get there. But I don't know.
[56:38] But it's there. Okay. Goodbye, Kiki. Goodbye, Kiki. Wow. Why do I try saying your name so many different times each time?
[56:51] Valorant. See, we're talking about breaking down a project. I can't break down words. Actually, I have a hard time sounding out words. I like Sid. Sid is easy. Thanks.
[57:08] But it's also something that I try to sound out the words to. Not just because I want it to be like easier or something. But because no matter where someone's from, it's not nice to just
[57:23] always go for the easier one. You know? Should be at least trying. In my mind, at least. All right. So, can we zoom in here? Oh, we can do white balance. Yeah. Focus mode. Autofocus.
[57:40] Focus on my face. I don't know if that's gonna work. But it's very slow. Hey. We can zoom.
[58:00] Not gonna lie. I don't know what all these zooms do. But hey. I don't know if you have to do it after the stream. But
[58:26] you can clip the well, I mean, it's gonna be in the stream. But you can clip that one part of it and use a link where I think you can download it.
[58:35] If you can't download it, let me know and I can download it. Paid time. Record setting. Format. I don't know what that does. Let's click and find out.
[58:56] Oh! I got really bright. Oh, no. You're good. Hey, now that we have it, you guys can actually see what I'm working on more.
[59:09] Wee! But that's white balance, I think. Where did Jason go? What does EV stand for? We can make it really dark.
[59:20] He's the film guru. Do any of you know what EV stands for? Yeah, there is a delay. It's annoying. Like, it's a delay even from me hitting the button to like everything I'm doing on my
[59:40] phone itself is like doing it real time. But doing the camera itself, when I'm doing camera stuff, it's still definitely delayed. Oh, no. Are you gonna make me restart it?
[59:53] You don't keep it if I go out of it? Dude, that's going to be really annoying. Bro, it was just, it was just working. Okay. Okay, can we turn it off?
[60:17] Why is it so delayed? Oh, y'all, shit. I gotta leave in like a minute. Like, leave to go pick up the van and go move stuff. I will post photos later.
[60:35] And stop screen share. Let's go find somebody. Yeah, for sure, Alex. Like, you're a homie. And you offered to teach all the random things and join the streams.
[60:49] And good luck with interviews. And next week. So I'll be probably streaming more this week because I got to work on this stuff. It took me an hour just to work on the camera. Like,
[61:04] that is annoying. Very annoying. But if I need to go find the Twitch and make sure to raid someone dope. And any requests on who we should raid to? If I don't see anybody that pops up.
[61:37] Why does it always go so weird? Oh, we got learn with Jason. Or we got Allie. Any requests? I'm going to give you like a minute, y'all. Because if you don't have requests,
[61:56] I'm just going to like click one. Okay. Learn with Jason it is. Start raid. And then it's like, it's so weird with these. Because it's like, you start to do it. Like,
[62:12] you start the raid. And then it takes a minute. It's so weird. Okay. Tell everybody hi from me to Jason. And have a wonderful Tuesday. Bye!
