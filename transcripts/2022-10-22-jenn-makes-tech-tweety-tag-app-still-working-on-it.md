[00:00] What up, what up, beautiful humans? I am going to be working on my project, my project that I keep talking about.
[00:14] And would be so rad if I got done today. So I will be streaming on again, off again today.
[00:21] I still wake it up for the day, it's 930 in the morning, but hey, you know, it is definitely I got a lot of work in front of me and I realized that.
[00:35] So I also did find like a streamy or streamy, a countdown, a timer on the YouTubes that I'm going to be using so that way I, A, remember to take breaks, I walk away for a bit.
[01:02] It's definitely something that I need to do for myself with getting through today. So yeah, I will be on again, off again, and I need to make sure that I'm sharing sound.
[01:17] I don't remember if I did, oh, that might work, do you, do you, no, not that one. Why am I so blind trying to get this going?
[01:42] So I'm going to go back to my voice tab. That's not it, that's not what I'm wanting, so let me, I don't know, y'all can hear the
[01:54] music in the background through my mic, I guess, is what I'm going with, because I need this to be going and to get started and I don't want to focus on this as much.
[02:06] So if you guys can hear it, great, if not, well, do well, do well. Okay, so I'm going to exit out of this, exit out of this, my apologies for the extra yawns
[02:29] this morning. You know what, no, I can't, I hurt my foot this week, and I was like, oh, I'll stand
[02:37] and work. Oh, wait, I can't, I should actually have my foot out.
[02:42] If you guys hear me in the background, this is me trying to figure out what I'm supposed to do with my foot with this cool leg brace on and not always the best at it, and it's
[02:56] okay. So, I need to show y'all my new game plan, because it has changed once again.
[03:11] The last few days, I have been streaming at least a little bit to get this project done, so what I want to show you is, when does it say I'm in here twice?
[03:30] I don't know, whatever, Miro, you're weird. So every week, I do this like auto-tagging part, and I'm really tired of doing it.
[03:45] Something that I talked about from the very beginning of starting these Twitter spaces is that it would be really cool if it just auto-tagged people that wanted to be tagged,
[03:54] and all I had to do was enter the Twitter space link and what I want that first tweet to say, and then enter the Twitter handle, and then voila, which there are probably products
[04:09] that do this. I get that.
[04:11] I do. But, yeah, I'm not going to learn how to do all of this stuff, unless it's something
[04:18] that I really want. That is the best way that I learn, at least, so I am making this.
[04:25] And what I've learned so far is no React app. That is old.
[04:32] I'll do it quick. I put an old one.
[04:34] Oh, good. The old one is here.
[04:38] Okay, so we are now just to start with Prisma, and I am completely restarting this project today.
[04:48] So I really don't know. Like, that's me, so I don't know what it's doing.
[04:58] Whatever. So we will start with Prisma, yay, because I think we're going to find this out.
[05:08] I can use this to also do the front end and the back end, like where people enter stuff, but, you know, we'll find out.
[05:20] It's normally how it goes. I do want to -- it's totally about to do something -- oh, this is also what I was going to post,
[05:51] because I actually posted my first Stack Overflow question. A little nerve-wracking, but nobody's actually replied on Stack Overflow, but luckily I have
[06:08] -- at least last time I checked -- but luckily there's been enough kind people that have replied for me, like from different communities that I'm a part of.
[06:19] So let me share that as well. I'll get a couple links to share of my journey throughout this.
[06:30] So let me get that set up, and whee, yeah, you guys can see my Deborah research. It's been a journey, it's definitely been a journey.
[06:57] And good morning again, I guess I could just put it on my face, because I'm doing a little bit offline, just because I want to get this set up.
[07:11] I also want to make sure that I don't stream anything that I'm not supposed to, because, well -- okay.
[07:31] So I am completely creating a new repo, because I just want to start from scratch, and actually following the directions on the Prisma's website, so I will be doing that.
[07:54] Also closing all my tabs right now, because I didn't actually do that before we got started today, because for myself -- I don't know about anybody else, but for myself, a lot
[08:05] of it is just showing up, and so I don't always show up the most prepared, and that's why, because showing up for me sometimes can be the hardest part, and I'm like, you know what?
[08:17] I'm just -- I'm just going to show up. It's going to be great.
[08:21] I'm just going to show up and figure it all out. And I do want to ask, what are all of you up to today, because I've got to say, streaming
[08:47] on -- it's the yay! Oh my God.
[08:52] That's just a fun name. Hi!
[08:54] What are you up to today? Anything fun?
[08:59] Because, again, I'm like, who streams on a Saturday -- okay, a lot of people probably do stream on a Saturday, and I'm just being judgmental, because I feel like a weirdo streaming
[09:13] today, because it's not in my, like, normal way of doing things. You hacked your high school's computers?
[09:22] I don't know if that's something that I should be impressed by. Like, I'm an adult, and I feel like that shouldn't be cool, but that is actually kind of cool.
[09:36] But don't do bad things, kids, because I don't want to be held responsible. But cool.
[09:41] What did you do with it? Like, did you just do it to do it, to try to show them that it's, like, easy to do,
[09:49] or why? Oh.
[09:54] Okay. Well, be careful with the knowledge.
[10:06] Knowledge is power, yes, but, like, don't get yourself suspended or something. That's not what I wanted.
[10:15] That's not what I wanted. That's what I wanted.
[10:21] And what's everybody else up to? I'm slowly working on this, like, links for today, so.
[11:07] I'm going to post this from time to time. There we go.
[11:16] So that's at least done. So if you guys are wondering what I'm doing and want to know the visualization, there
[11:22] you go. And then I will get started with Prisma.
[11:31] Let me get this up on the other screen. Ookie dokie.
[12:03] And I just want to say, I don't know how often anybody else does this. Like, if you do a stream or you're planning on coding all day.
[12:10] But I have, like, snacks and drinks. So I have my coffee, candy, dandy coffee.
[12:16] I have, I'm not drinking this entire thing right now, just as a heads up. I have my kombucha, because I love kombucha.
[12:24] My sparkling water, because I feel really bougie for liking this stuff, but I blame travel.
[12:34] Because this sparkling water is a lot more popular in other countries, and I absolutely love it.
[12:40] And then I have granola bars. And a banana that I've been keeping in the fridge, because I wanted it to last longer.
[12:49] I'm not eating them as fast, so I may be taking food breaks, too. Who knows?
[12:55] All right. So I am...
[12:57] Can I quit everything? Huh.
[12:59] Nope. Yeah, you guys don't get to see my chats.
[13:01] I gotta move those to the other screen. Make sure, you know, if anybody hits me up.
[13:03] In with this. Yay.
[13:05] Start right here. Perfect.
[13:07] All right. Let's get started.
[13:24] So... We're gonna get a quick start.
[13:34] And, y'all, just as a heads up, I will... Yes, I know I'm not supposed to be showing any of my database stuff for these exercises.
[13:49] I will be, because I just want it to work first, and I'll be changing it later on once I actually have a working app.
[13:58] So thank you for everyone's concern there. I just want to let you know.
[14:06] Yeah. No need to be, like, super, super concerned.
[14:10] I do know that. Okay.
[15:01] So... Okay.
[15:08] So... I need to make sure that I told the people that have helped me on this project so far
[15:40] that they helped me. Okay.
[15:46] I've never... Well, okay.
[15:54] So I started using TypeScript. I will be going a bit more with the training with Josh Goldberg, learning TypeScript.
[16:05] Actually, let me grab that information for you. I'm not sure about it.
[16:38] I think this is the hard part about streaming, is, like, staying focused to do something. But that's a big reason I like doing this stuff while streaming, is it makes me go,
[17:02] "Oh, yeah. Okay.
[17:04] I need to, you know, figure this out." So let's get Josh's Twitter.
[17:35] Occasionally, I will be yelling at my doggo because she is a troublemaker. Best way to say it.
[18:05] She is a troublemaker. She is a troublemaker.
[18:52] She is a bulldog/pit bull mix. If you follow me on Twitter, there are lots of random photos of her.
[19:07] She is a bulldog/pit bull mix. She is a bulldog/pit bull mix.
[19:55] She is a bulldog/pit bull mix. Because this is going to be a biweekly occurrence with having Josh on the show, so let me -- okay.
[20:48] We have it fixed. We have it fixed.
[21:11] Okay. No.
[21:13] Also, I thought I was sharing my screen, but clearly I wasn't. That's cool.
[21:15] All the random time that I was doing stuff. Okay.
[21:46] So I'm going to do a start with Prisma from scratch. I feel like I probably want JavaScript because I haven't done TypeScript very much, and we're
[22:00] going to be using MySQL. We're also going to see if we can get it in the right order of GitHub for setting them
[22:25] up. I literally have been struggling with it, and I don't think I've actually taken notes
[22:31] on the proper way to start a new repo. I've been told many, many people just do it on GitHub, so you know what?
[22:39] Let's just do it that way. Not try to complicate stuff.
[22:44] So go to GitHub, and we are going to start a new one, starting a new one because I want to keep the old repos as a learning process, so we will call this one TweetyTag.
[23:14] Do you want to read me a file, you want, ignore, but I don't think we want a template. This part I get really confused on.
[23:42] I probably get that on a clarification. I know I want MIT.
[23:53] So one of the reasons this is so easy once you create it here is if you go into code, you can get the GitHub CLI to make a clone repo for your desktop, so copy, paste, so
[24:16] we have that going. Oh, wait.
[24:18] Ah, damn it. I put it in the wrong thing.
[24:23] This is also something that I, like, realize I struggle with. I'm also going very, very lazy over here.
[24:30] Oh, shit, it's not even in my desktop. I don't really feel like doing that right now to go search for it, but I also need to
[24:41] rename this. It's something that's not SEO.
[24:49] Ooh, created content. I think that will help me.
[24:57] Okay. So let's do CD desktop, and then code, and now we will create the clone.
[25:13] Voila! I think it's in the right place now.
[25:19] So it should go here to TweetyDag. Okay, what am I doing?
[25:40] Oh, I've been told that this is also where you have to do, like, a refresh or just close it and open it, because it may not always read what you've done.
[26:18] Oh, I just copy and pasted it. Yay, it went in there.
[26:23] What up, Jambo? Jambot.
[26:25] Wow, I can read. A lovely creation of probably not the greatest stuff, but okay, it is, yeah, the day is just
[26:48] getting started. So I am working on all that quick visual, just because I'm also trying to explain it
[26:58] to people enough that they ask questions. So if I'm not maybe thinking about it the right way or something, because there's a
[27:08] lot of other people that are very, very good at this stuff, is I host a mental health Twitter space in tech every Wednesday.
[27:20] And I basically do the same thing, like people can DM me and stuff and say that they want to be tagged manually for the reminder.
[27:26] I'm like, y'all, I don't want to do this anymore. Like, this is exhausting.
[27:32] I really want to create an app where they enter their Twitter handle, I enter the Twitter space, it combines in the database and auto does everything, which has had a few renditions
[27:46] of this project. It first started with React and then didn't know that I had to have something for the
[27:56] backend to go to MySQL. So those are the versions that didn't work.
[28:01] The new updated version is to do it through Prisma from scratch and then connect it to MySQL and then look at the Twitter API.
[28:13] And yes, there are probably things that do this, yet this is my journey of seeing if I can make it work.
[28:21] So that is not the quickest way of explaining what I'm doing, but yes. And I'm also, if anybody's curious why I'm using Ivan, is I really want to like make
[28:40] an app with databases and then be able to like change out databases and see like how that works.
[28:50] Because apparently like if you change the databases and stuff on the backend, it won't affect the front end at all.
[28:56] And I want to see if that helps. Oh, thanks.
[29:03] Yay. See, that makes way more sense.
[29:12] And for anyone else watching, Baki is like the cutest dog ever, ever, ever, in case anybody's curious, ever.
[29:33] And I got to say like, this is the super fun thing of streaming is you get to see all this and I am working on, okay.
[29:52] So I got my directory, I'm going to skip this because I've already done this for Tweety Tag.
[30:00] What are you up to this weekend? Anything fun?
[30:07] Are you back home? Are you still traveling?
[30:15] Ooh, are you doing any competitions soon? Yay, that's exciting.
[30:35] We're talking about road tripping, maybe if we can like, but I need to get a real job first, so, all right.
[30:46] So I'm doing it in JavaScript. I'm doing MySQL.
[30:49] Okay. Follow directions.
[30:52] I feel like y'all, this is one of the hardest pieces is me following directions, because I, not because like, I don't want to follow directions, but I skip through.
[31:05] I have learned I'm like super dyslexic and it's something that a lot of people with dyslexia naturally do, and please take photos of training Baki and probably Arizona and
[31:22] San Diego, like take the dog and we're going to go hang out, you know? I just don't know what that's going to look like.
[31:33] So we will find out. Oh, I was like, what's funny?
[31:42] I mean, I am funny, but oh, this is actually pretty funny. I have a playlist to send you, well, I'll share it with everyone.
[31:57] I just need to create it, but back in the day when baby Jen first started trying to do this, like learning live thing, it was way too shy to be on the camera and figuring
[32:10] all of that out, it was pretty great. I know, I can be, sometimes I'm just all too serious.
[32:23] Yay, now you can invoke Prisma CLI, I'm pretty sure, I just realized I could hit this over here.
[32:40] That's cool. So I know stuff should be installed.
[33:05] Let's see. Okay, connect your database.
[33:52] You're excited to see you have JavaScript homework today after class, maybe you follow along.
[34:03] Yes, it is fun. It is a lot of fun, but I have been like streaming so much the last couple of days, like, oh,
[34:15] Damian, I don't know if you saw my really, really cool Twitter. I am giggling at this because I like straight up, like you're not even going to be surprised
[34:34] at all by this, which is pretty funny. So many computers I haven't reinstalled.
[34:46] So I will do a text message. Just look at those bruises and y'all, oh, I guess I can put that here too.
[35:01] Because I don't install my Twitter, so it's totally public, but y'all, me and my luck. What, whatever, whatever.
[35:16] Well, then I can show this one on my really cool Twitter-ness. Hold, please.
[35:33] So I'm little, Damian knows this, he, I'm totally laughing because, so Damian, you see this stool right here, I was standing on it trying to get something off the top shelf
[35:57] and I fell and these are some lovely bruises and I have a really cool boot now. It's super rad, but it's just kind of funny with all the, I do this stuff all the time
[36:19] throughout my entire life. I cannot just freaking see this.
[36:24] I do not understand VS Code. Oh, I don't care if you follow me too, like why, like if you retweet or something, like
[36:40] really, am I surprised? I did this on Wednesday and I got the boot yesterday because like, I'm on Mac.
[37:03] For the, it happens Wednesday, the first two days weren't bad, but yesterday I couldn't really walk very well and it was getting worse, like the swelling was getting way worse.
[37:14] So I went and went to the urgent care and they're like, you need to get x-rays. We're hoping that it is just, you know, nothing serious, but it could be fractured or broken,
[37:33] which x-rays came back, everything's clear. They're pretty sure if I just chill in the boot thing for a few weeks, I'll be fine,
[37:42] but they are concerned that I might've done something to the tendon, but they're not going to say go get an MRI until I give it some time to get un-poofy.
[37:54] So yes, I am on Mac. Okay.
[37:58] So we need to do this and hit enter because that makes a lot of sense why I have to do that every time.
[38:14] Yay. Yeah.
[38:20] Yeah. That's why, like, I try to tell people it's not a like shocking thing, like I posted it
[38:37] just because I found it really funny. Oh, to live stream.
[38:43] Yeah. A hundred percent.
[38:45] Because if I don't live stream, then I won't get my work done. Well, I think it's a lot of like, I get stuck on things or may not go on the right path.
[38:57] So when people ask questions, a lot of times it helps me connect the dots too. And doing this live, let's see, Thursday night I started this project and I spent like two
[39:13] hours on it. Yesterday I spent an hour on it.
[39:16] Today I'm just going to be streaming on again, off again, all day. So it's like where, when even people just stopping by to say hi, I'm like, oh yeah,
[39:28] okay, cool. Like, but you know me, I like talking to people.
[39:32] Like yesterday, my neighbors were outside and I hid from them because I don't want to talk to them when I need to get groceries off the counter.
[39:40] I want to go, I did this yesterday and yes, everyone, I know that I'm putting all of this content public for my SQL database.
[40:05] This is a learning thing, not a actually use thing yet. Once I do actually use it, I will get things updated, so.
[40:33] And we are, my SQL. I'm going to go to my SQL.env.
[41:26] Okay. So, I'm going to go to my SQL.env.
[41:56] Are you going to, Damien, if you're still there, are you going to keep doing live streams of Baki?
[42:18] Are you still doing those? Because I feel like I wouldn't have that in the background while I'm doing this.
[42:44] What if you just had it like far and away? Or is he just like in too many rooms?
[43:21] I didn't enter my commit message and it's going to like freak out on me. Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
[43:48] Y'all, his dog is so cute. So cute.
[43:57] Can you stop trying to commit since I didn't do a comment because you're going to get mad. Bye Damien, thanks for saying hi.
[44:15] Might be here later, probably be here later. Why did I forget?
[44:31] I want to. I just want to say, everybody, like trying to go between different frameworks is really
[45:21] frustrating. I have two of these open.
[45:23] I don't know. We don't need to.
[45:25] We are using JavaScript. Yellow.
[45:54] Black. This is not it.
[46:32] Okay. I'm going to go back to my PowerPoint.
[47:11] That was yesterday's thing. Go away, Android Studio.
[47:32] And for everyone that has just joined, let me see. Let me get you.
[48:04] I am currently and I'm not going to explain this every time because I feel like it's going to absolutely drive everyone insane.
[48:12] I am currently working on these things. You can go check it out.
[48:45] I'm going to go back to my PowerPoint. I'm going to go back to my PowerPoint.
[49:43] I'm going to go back to my PowerPoint. I'm going to go back to my PowerPoint.

[89:33] I'm going to go back to my PowerPoint. I'm going to go back to my PowerPoint.
[89:35] I'm going to go back to my PowerPoint. I'm going to go back to my PowerPoint.
[89:37] I'm going to go back to my PowerPoint. I'm going to go back to my PowerPoint.
[89:44] I'm going to turn down a little bit though. All right.
[89:46] So we have our music. This is exciting.
[89:48] This is exciting. I needed something a bit more upbeat.
[89:56] I'm going to close this one. I'm going to copy it first just in case anybody wanted it.
[90:02] I'm going to copy it first just in case anybody wanted it. Okay.
[90:18] Let's close this. I'm going to make it any smaller.
[90:37] There we go. It would not show that, but whatever.
[90:46] Okay. Does YouTube not do the pop out anymore?
[90:53] Because I thought they did. But I honestly -- theater mode.
[91:02] No. Mini view.
[91:09] Maybe it's theater mode that I'm thinking of. Why am I clicking?
[91:25] Especially when I have good stuff. All right.
[91:29] Whatever. I am so much wasted real estate.
[91:34] Whatever. Whatever.
[91:38] Okay. I'm going to do that after I set this up.
[91:50] There we go. Whoa!
[92:18] Okay. You guys get it full screen, but I don't.
[92:26] That is pretty fun. We're doing this because you probably want to see more of this.
[92:36] This being my ultimate laptop cooling pad with big fan, fancy RGB LED design.
[92:47] There you go. There you go.
[92:50] There you go. You get a cool box.
[92:57] See if I have it the right direction. No?
[92:59] This way? I think so.
[93:05] Let's see how I set this up and if I can get it to work. Because streaming and doing all of this stuff,
[93:13] my laptop gets really, really mad. Let's see if I can get one.
[93:20] Maybe from the next company I work for. If I start streaming from that device.
[93:26] Either way, I think this will be good to have. All right.
[93:48] I'm getting there. Do any of you use --
[93:57] I'm getting there. Many players then pop out?
[94:03] Oh. I just looked up and I just got that one.
[94:09] Hold on. Let's stop screening.
[94:19] Let's see. Many player.
[94:31] I don't have that. I just have like expand.
[94:38] But I think it's because I'm on a laptop instead of my tablet or phone.
[94:48] Let's see if I can get this big again. Yes, YouTube is providing all of this music
[94:57] just to give you guys a heads up. Yes.
[95:00] Yes. Let me make that bigger.
[95:07] I kind of like this layout. I feel like this would be easier for everybody
[95:12] to see my screen while I'm doing stuff. It just has expand.
[95:16] Let's see. I don't have pop out.
[95:23] What happened, YouTube? I just want the pop out.
[95:29] Settings? No.
[95:33] How to play? Off.
[95:41] Are you in Chrome and are you on your mobile device? Yes, I am.
[95:47] I'm on my mobile device. Let's see if I can get this banner down.
[95:52] There we go. What up, Nate?
[96:04] Okay. It is there when you hover over the video now.
[96:14] There's more. You know what?
[96:18] I don't want to -- I don't have the concentration for it. It will just go like that.
[96:23] That's fine. All right.
[96:30] Back to the fan for now because I think it's cool. Oh, it has like a little stand.
[96:41] Oh, I can tilt. It will let you tilt your laptop.
[96:48] Yeah. I just got a laptop cooling pad.
[96:52] I'm taking a break from coding. Well, I took a break from coding.
[96:58] Then I found my cooling fan. Well, during my break because I was cleaning.
[97:06] So we will see if I can power this. I don't even know if I have enough ports.
[97:14] I might have to -- oh, you can change light mode, color mode. It's going to have lights, y'all.
[97:21] I'm not going to lie. The big reason I got this specific one is because it lit up.
[97:27] All right. Well, for a moment, I don't know where the camera is going to go.
[97:34] I'm just going to look at my screen for a moment. Oh, it even has like the front thing.
[97:45] Oh, that's fun. Oh, my God.
[97:50] Oh, my God. Don't die.
[97:52] Please don't die. What are you doing?
[97:58] Yeah, it's supposed to be this way. All right.
[98:01] Okay. I will say this probably would have been better to do, like, you know,
[98:10] before I was streaming. But we just found it.
[98:13] And I'm not going to cancel my stream now. Because why?
[98:19] Because why? Do I have a USB port on this one?
[98:23] I do. All right.
[98:25] And. Oh, it's so pretty.
[98:34] All right. Let's.
[98:40] I don't know how that's. Well, that's new.
[98:53] Okay. Okay.
[98:59] So, yes, it totally changed the camera angle, but. Let's see.
[99:02] I'm looking at camera. Okay.
[99:05] First off. Everyone.
[99:09] Please observe the dog. Please observe the dog.
[99:13] She is my coworker. She is.
[99:17] Way cooler than I am. Yes, I'm talking about you.
[99:20] Okay. This is Kiona.
[99:24] In case anybody wants to know. But.
[99:30] Wait, wait, wait. There we go.
[99:34] It's cool. Set up.
[99:36] Yay. And it's the way up.
[99:40] Okay. It's probably way too exciting, but.
[99:45] For me, that's okay. Okay.
[99:50] And it only took me like 10 minutes to set up. Actually, you are super close.
[99:56] It's with an E. Yes, homie.
[100:00] Can you guys hear me okay, though? Like I changed the location of my mic a little bit.
[100:05] And I've been meaning to ask. I totally forgot.
[100:08] Dope. Okay.
[100:18] That just makes it. Oh, thank you for stepping on the trash on your way out.
[100:25] Oh, yeah. Okay.
[100:41] That's what I was going to go. Okay.
[101:20] Okay. I'm trying to mute it.
[101:34] So you guys don't hear me like yelling across the house. What are you doing?
[101:40] I feel like, okay. So for video editing.
[101:46] I feel like it's not that bad. I don't know.
[101:50] I disassociate. I'm like, that's some other person.
[101:56] So that makes it easier for me. Because I have to edit so much.
[102:02] Well, I should be editing more. Yeah.
[102:07] It makes it a lot easier. So when I fuck up, it doesn't, like, you know, get to me.
[102:12] So. I'm not as critical on like my own self image.
[102:24] Because I'm like, if it was someone else, I wouldn't be caring about X, Y, Z.
[102:30] It's because of my own insecurities. So it makes it a little easier that way.
[102:33] I don't know. But I needed to figure out this database.
[102:36] So. Yeah.
[102:50] And I would say like the cool thing is, is like the hard cuts. Are like what's in right now.
[102:56] So you don't have to do really weird transitions. Which I think makes it easier.
[102:59] Especially if you like. People won't notice if you punch it in and then like go out.
[103:05] So. Yeah.
[103:11] What are you doing? I don't understand why you haven't done that yet.
[103:14] We're going to exit. Safe.
[103:31] Yeah, it's definitely time consuming. I mean, it was just saying it's super time consuming.
[103:36] So is. But I mean,
[103:39] It's definitely worth it in my opinion. All right.
[103:45] Have you decided? I need to actually put a message.
[103:50] Yeah. Okay.
[104:04] Okay. Okay.
[104:35] You can actually upload it. Yes.
[104:46] Did it. Okay.
[105:00] The F F M P E G. Okay.
[105:32] I'm mostly just use final cut. And.
[105:36] Descript. Okay.
[106:07] Okay. Oh.
[106:23] Okay. Got it. Got it. I mean, premier shouldn't have an issue with that.
[106:29] Cause when I was. Yeah.
[106:39] I would do it with final cut or Adobe. Like I had to go between the two of them.
[106:44] And Adobe can handle like, you know, 4k videos pretty easily.
[106:52] And I, it really, at least in my experience, it really does matter where, like what your hardware is though.
[106:58] Okay. So new, beautiful humans.
[107:04] I am. I have a lot that I'm working with.
[107:09] So let me show you. Okay.
[107:38] Wrong place that I was totally about to put this. Okay.
[107:51] Okay. Okay.
[108:22] Okay. Do y'all know, can you embed.
[108:42] An I-frame and markdown. I was trying to look it up last night while I was playing D and D and that just wasn't working.
[108:47] Okay. Okay.
[109:40] Okay. Okay.
[110:15] I'm not embedding the YouTube bed. I just found this one. I want to embed the mirror board like this thing.
[110:23] So I can be like, go look at my project. And then you can stop asking me questions.
[110:27] Not that I just like people asking me questions. I just feel like I've been on repeat.
[110:32] And I'm going to miss something because I'm saying it so much. Okay.
[110:45] I can share this. And get in bed code.
[110:58] Well, it's not an image though. Okay.
[111:06] It's like an image, but it should let you like scroll around. And expand it.
[111:11] I mean, I could do it as an image, but I figured as I'm. Like changing this, it could be cool for people to be able to.
[111:22] Okay. And I'm totally open for.
[111:34] Suggestions on this one. Because this is not what I want to spend my entire day doing.
[111:44] I just know that it's going to be worth it to get it done. Okay.
[112:03] Oh, wait. Well, those are videos.
[112:07] Okay. I think my dog is back.
[112:31] You are back. Okay. I heard her chewing on her bone.
[112:35] Okay. And if you throw it in there and hit preview, see if it works.
[112:43] I was doing that a bit last night. I was sipping wine and D and D.
[112:51] So. Straight up.
[112:55] Not a hundred percent sure if it worked or not. And then in preview.
[113:03] Okay. It was, it was, it really is a really good Friday night.
[113:11] It's so fun. I'm going to leave it there.
[113:21] It's just going to stay there. Okay.
[113:35] We don't need this to look up. Okay.
[114:10] Okay. We're going to commit.
[114:15] Sweet. So now I can just share this.
[114:29] Okay. So I went to the farmer's market for like the first time in years,
[114:52] like not even just like because of COVID, but like just in general. And they have like giant bottles of kombucha.
[114:58] So. Make sure it doesn't explode on me.
[115:07] I shook it up a little bit. Yay.
[115:21] Okay. I know I got two of them.
[115:46] Nate, did I like explain enough to you or did I just like, get distracted with.
[115:49] Okay. So what I'm going to do is.
[115:54] I do this. What I'm trying to do is.
[116:01] I'm going to go to the visual project just because it makes it a lot easier to see.
[116:04] It is. Originally I was going to do a react app.
[116:11] To my SQL. And then I realized it is.
[116:18] So. So I figured out between going to react to Prisma.
[116:29] Then my SQL. That reacts.
[116:31] Prisma is not going to work. So I started with Prisma.
[116:35] We started the project today. And I'm currently importing.
[116:39] My SQL. Okay.
[117:13] Okay. Okay.
[117:47] My. Bookmark bar.
[117:53] Okay. And honestly, like I've worked with databases.
[118:05] But it's been existing databases. And I'm kind of stuck on this part.
[118:16] It's silly that I'm stuck on this, but. Okay.
[118:59] So let me bring this one up. Okay.
[119:11] All right. So I have Prisma installed.
[119:15] Cool. Gravy.
[119:18] I connected the database. Yay.
[119:24] But what I'm struggling with is like. I have to set up.
[119:34] Or the database, like I have to, you know, set up it's. Inputs and everything, like what it's.
[119:40] Categorizing. And that's what I'm getting a bit stuff on is.
[119:49] Remembering like. Yeah.
[120:02] Yeah. Because wouldn't this be where I put in like the Twitter handle and the
[120:12] Twitter space link. Would be.
[120:15] Okay. Yeah.
[120:29] So. I think the other part that I'm a little confused on is.
[120:39] Like. Post is what goes down, like as a column.
[120:48] And then. On this reference profile is what goes across the top.
[120:55] I think that's what I'm really having a hard time doing is like. Just picturing it.
[121:02] I'm not sure if I'm remembering. Correctly. These are different classes.
[121:14] Okay. Okay. So different objects. So I only need.
[121:43] The Twitter handle. And the Twitter space.
[121:51] Yeah. Because the output.
[121:57] I'll have the same output every time. Like I can put default texts.
[122:01] As the output. Pretty sure.
[122:10] Okay. Not yet. I think that's what I'm struggling with.
[122:20] So why don't I go make that. I'm not going to use all the names that I have right now.
[122:33] Like I want to. New folder. Sure. Why not?
[122:35] We'll make a new folder. We're going to make a new folder.
[122:38] And I'm going to make a new folder. I'm going to make a new folder.
[122:45] That's the name I came up with and. Some.
[122:49] In. A Twitter space yesterday.
[122:57] We file, we need a Google sheets, which will let me export it this way. What are you in?
[123:06] Okay. Oh, but.
[123:17] Well, let me do a. I was.
[123:27] Right. But is it. I guess the reason I want to go here is for the visualization of it.
[123:35] So. I can.
[123:39] Show up in a notes.txt. Where, if I like figure it out here, I can export it and put it in there.
[123:47] But I can use this for the visualization. Or I could put it on the mirror board. Right. Like.
[123:56] I would at least give it all in one spot. And then put it in the notes.txt.
[124:02] Or something. So.
[124:09] I don't know where I'm logged in, where else I'm logged in, but whatever. Because what I'm thinking for the.
[124:14] Database. Let me.
[124:21] Okay. Oh, my goodness.
[124:37] Way too big. Okay.
[124:52] Well, go. Please don't take down my backdrop.
[125:07] And I think that's where I'm getting mixed up. Okay.
[125:26] I'm going to do it here as a table, just so that way I can. Like get a visual on it.
[125:33] Cause I think that's what I'm struggling with right now is the visual. Okay.
[126:03] I like that. Yes.
[126:06] And I'm going to do it like this because this is like how I picture. Database.
[126:14] Or at least when I first like learned it. I would like to rename you.
[126:21] Oh, maybe not. Because I think the other part is.
[126:27] In the database. What I wanted to export.
[126:53] So, you know, example would be like. I'm going to have more.
[127:27] Okay. Okay.
[128:09] What you export is better. Okay.
[128:21] And that being said, like, I think the other part I'm stuck on is. If.
[128:29] So if I scroll up really quick, like. Look at this.
[128:37] So I'm going to be. I'm going to have this.
[128:44] Is going to be the Twitter space link. Yeah. I'll also need to enter the, like what texts I want it to say.
[128:55] So like this one says, hello, beautiful humans. Looking forward to hearing you today.
[128:58] But I would think. That if I have that as a default.
[129:02] I don't need it as part of the database. So.
[129:11] That's where I'm kind of struggling because. Tweet one and tweet.
[129:19] Would just be the text from those two messages. Okay.
[129:48] Okay. Okay.
[130:25] Real quick. I'm going on my phone to make my Twitter space. So I can at least.
[130:31] I can see. Pretty spinny.
[130:46] Okay. I haven't even made it like easy for that.
[131:18] Okay. Okay.
[132:05] Okay. When are you not doing things?
[132:30] Okay. Wednesday.
[132:49] Okay. So I think actually.
[133:16] There's also a. Part that I'll need to know for the.
[133:25] Okay. Okay.
[133:57] Okay. Okay.
[134:53] Okay. So that only uses it as part of the image.
[134:59] So. I'm going to say, so we need the Twitter space.
[135:06] And here's. My example.
[135:14] And then. Tweet one.
[135:20] Okay. Said before.
[135:34] Space. Okay.
[136:08] Okay. I can emojis y'all use emojis too much.
[136:30] Okay. Okay.
[137:07] Yeah, but let me write this really quick. So that way you can kind of maybe see it a bit better.
[137:12] Okay. Okay.
[137:46] Nice. Okay.
[138:18] This is what I want it to look like. Okay.
[138:28] So that, but I always wanted to say like, hello, beautiful humans. This week we're talking about.
[138:32] And then. Like.
[138:37] It's kind of, okay. Words.
[138:40] Words. I.
[138:45] I want to. Go this way.
[138:49] Okay. Will be Twitter.
[139:10] Name. Okay.
[139:20] Is the name. But this part will always be the same, like a tweet or.
[139:30] Like to create tweet one, it would be. Okay.
[139:47] Okay. Okay.
[140:17] Okay. And then it would be.
[140:32] And then Twitter. Space.
[140:36] Link. Okay.
[140:50] It's actually nice. Okay.
[141:14] Sweet. Would be.
[141:23] Same. And.
[141:29] Okay. We're on here.
[141:42] Oh, oh. Okay.
[142:00] Why did you do that? Okay.
[142:33] Okay. Okay.
[143:23] And then. Okay.
[143:30] And then. Three would be.
[143:44] Okay. Okay.
[144:19] Okay. Okay.
[144:45] Okay. Okay.
[145:39] Okay. Okay.
[145:55] Progress. Now, I don't know what I'm actually putting in the database, but. Actually, let me move this.
[146:00] Okay. Like all of the tweets.
[146:10] Are like. What it would retrieve except tweet two would be a default,
[146:24] but tweet one would be. Okay.
[146:30] A default plus retrieving two things from the database. So that's why I'm wondering what I just have.
[146:37] Three. Parts of the database because it's the Twitter handles the Twitter space
[146:48] link and the Twitter space name. Would that be the only things I would need to.
[146:51] I feel like it's a yes. I don't know.
[146:55] I feel like it's a yes. I'm not sure.
[146:57] I feel like it's a yes. I don't know.
[146:59] I feel like it's a yes. I don't know.

[147:55] I feel like it's a yes. I don't know.
[147:57] I feel like it's a yes. I don't know.
[147:59] I feel like it's a yes. I don't know.

[273:55] I don't know. I feel like it's a yes.
[273:57] I don't know. I feel like it's a yes.
[274:00] Okay. Here we go.
[274:03] And then I click paste. And I do something with this.
[274:10] Here's a quick overview of the different parts of the code snippet. Import the Prisma client.
[274:16] That makes sense. And instantiate.
[274:22] Define async. Call main function.
[274:26] Close database connections. Inside main function.
[274:30] Add the following query. To read user records.
[274:34] What up, best nest? How's it going?
[274:38] We are doing something. I say it like I don't know what we're doing.
[274:46] It's more like I don't know what we're overall. I am working on some really riveting stuff.
[274:57] I say it like that because I'm also just -- I don't know. I really like coding, but I'm like how is this interesting for other people?
[275:07] Yeah, I find it so fascinating. It's very confusing for me.
[275:13] All right. So that is what we are working on.
[275:21] Just so that way you can see all the updates. I am working on making a Twitter tagging thingamajig.
[275:30] And are learning my databases. This is the visual.
[275:38] I want to make something that auto does all of this for me. Like, yes, I'll manually have to go put in all -- like create my Twitter spaces.
[275:50] But that it will put in a message, the Twitter space. The next thread is the, like, default.
[275:58] And then just like this one post. And then after that, it will just auto tag everyone.
[276:05] So we got enter Twitter handle and enter Twitter space link. Combine them.
[276:12] And make this. Which is not that easy.
[276:16] It might be out there in the world, but I'm working on creating it myself. And then we have -- we're doing everything with Prisma.
[276:25] Because I found out yesterday React won't work with it. And then I'm using Ivan for my database.
[276:31] Because I'm not used to databases. So Ivan allows you to switch them out on the back end to a different type of database.
[276:40] And I'm curious about trying that later on. And then the Twitter API.
[276:44] And hopefully -- I'm glad it looks simple to you. Like, I'm a noob.
[276:50] And I'm like, I don't know. I don't know.
[276:53] I'm learning it all. But this is what we're working on.
[276:57] So now that I am in here, inside the main function, add the following query. To read all user records from the database results.
[277:11] And I did not use user. So I will need to do -- okay.
[277:20] Wait. Add the following query.
[277:36] So I'm adding it. Oh.
[277:49] Oh. I see where I'm going.
[277:51] Wrong area. Paste.
[278:05] I will teach and explain as I'm going. This is definitely a learning experience.
[278:10] And right. It looks simple.
[278:12] But it's not so much. And that's okay.
[278:15] That is okay. Because -- have you done any coding so far?
[278:42] All right. I want -- nice.
[278:54] Nice. I dig it.
[278:57] It's a great way to spend a Saturday. And it's a great way to get into coding.
[279:24] It's fun. You can figure out, like, when you get -- if you ever get into coding, it's really fun.
[279:28] Because you can get it to do stuff. And I say that only because, like, I love puzzles.
[279:32] And the puzzle I'm figuring out right now is what all users are. Because I -- go to definition.
[279:43] Yeah. There's no definition.
[279:46] And by definition -- yes. >> Are you thinking -- let's try to add a person in.
[279:52] Let's go back to your schema and see what model. What did we name that?
[279:56] The person model. The handle model.
[279:59] >> Twitter handle. >> Twitter handle.
[280:04] >> That's what I was going to try. >> Yeah, let's add one.
[280:08] >> Because if I do this, right? >> If you scroll down on the docs that you were looking at, the next one is going to show right data into the database.
[280:22] The first one was querying. But we have nothing to query in there.
[280:25] We have no users or anything, I don't think. So it won't have anything.
[280:29] But we can write in -- let's write in the first Twitter handle. Let's use that function as a skeleton.
[280:35] >> Oh, okay. >> So we'll use the same async function, main.
[280:40] Await. Prisma.
[280:48] Ours would be Prisma.Twitter handle. >> Okay.
[280:51] So I need to get rid of this one because we're not going to use -- >> Yes, perfect.
[280:55] >> Okay. I want all of these.
[281:01] >> Perfect. You can get rid of that comment, too.
[281:04] You don't need it anymore. >> I don't know.
[281:07] I kind of like the comment because it keeps -- like, I know where I'm going, but I get it. It's line five.
[281:13] If I forget -- >> You got it.
[281:15] Yeah. >> All right.
[281:17] >> You know. I was the same way.
[281:19] That's why I'm encouraging you, too, because I used to keep every comment. I'm like, no, it's too much.
[281:24] You know now. Okay.
[281:26] So we just changed yours to fit for the Twitter handle, yeah? >> Yeah.
[281:31] So I am going back to Twitter handle. You know what?
[281:39] Let me -- oh, I can. Can I put these side by side?
[281:42] >> Yeah. >> Yeah, you can.
[281:46] >> Looking like a boss. >> There we go.
[281:51] So get rid of this. So await Prisma Twitter handle data will be -- so it's auto going to create the ID, right?
[282:17] Wait. Hold on.
[282:20] You are correct. Don't go back.
[282:22] You were right. I've got to auto increment and add the own ID.
[282:26] So the only piece of data you'll be passing in is -- >> The Twitter handle.
[282:32] >> Perfect. >> Because I don't need the rest of this.
[282:36] >> Perfect. >> Okay.
[282:38] But I need -- >> Feels good to delete.
[282:40] Feels good to delete. >> Okay.
[282:53] And it's not going to be all users. It will be all -- Twitter handle?
[282:59] I think. And this is all Twitter handle.
[283:05] And Twitter handle. Posts.
[283:15] >> I think if you look at that, the variable you just made, the const all Twitter handle, I think you would want to name that Twitter handles, yeah. Because that variable is going to be all Twitter handles.
[283:30] >> Oh. >> But the second one will actually be Twitter handle because that's the name in your model, right?
[283:38] But if you're naming the variable, down, down, right there. Const all Twitter handles.
[283:44] Because that's your -- you're going to find those Twitter handles. Not there.
[283:48] The name of the variable. >> On line 12?
[283:52] >> Right there. Yep.
[283:54] Yep. Line 12.
[283:56] Sorry. I should have looked at the line number.
[283:59] Yeah. Yeah.
[284:03] Perfect. >> And then the console directory?
[284:07] >> It's console.dir. Yep.
[284:10] And then you put your variable again. Perfect.
[284:13] >> Okay. Okay.
[284:17] >> Okay. >> I just need to make sure user is not anywhere again.
[284:22] And then save. And then go back.
[284:31] Wah! Excuse me.
[284:35] Pardon. I don't want you to take up the whole screen.
[284:39] Thank you. Rude.
[284:45] I let go. Thank you.
[284:47] Okay. This creates a new user with post profile.
[284:56] I'm going to say you have not included posts to run this command. I don't know why it's not showing up down there.
[285:19] There we go. Maybe go to that top one because that second one doesn't look like it's in the right directory.
[285:29] I can't see what the name is. There you go.
[285:33] Use that one. >> Yeah.
[285:35] That one just doesn't show anything. It doesn't click it or anything.
[285:37] >> Maybe close it and open it again. There we go.
[285:40] >> Yeah. This one's in Tweety tag.
[285:42] >> Okay. Perfect.
[285:44] Perfect. I just couldn't see it.
[285:46] >> But it's seen model not found. So index.g.
[285:51] Maybe I didn't save. I think I saved.
[285:55] No. You're wanting to make changes.
[285:59] I'm not ready for that. So...
[286:06] Okay. Error cannot find module index.js.
[286:32] Oh. Oh.
[286:37] I'm going to move it out of SRC and see if it's red. >> Move it.
[286:44] Yes. Thank you.
[286:47] >> Perfect. Perfect.
[286:49] You figured that one out. Okay.
[286:57] What did -- I can't see the readout. >> Yeah, neither can I.
[287:23] >> So it looks like you have to get rid of the include. Go to your function.
[287:31] >> Oh. >> Get rid of that.
[287:34] Because it's all one thing. I didn't even notice that either.
[287:36] It's already the Twitter handle, right? Oh.
[287:53] And because of that, that means -- I think. >> Look at that.
[288:07] Did you see that? Did you see that?
[288:09] Yeah! We queried your database.
[288:15] >> Okay. Can I say -- is ID1 the --
[288:23] >> That's the auto increment, remember? Can you move that little block from -- it's right in front of the terminal.
[288:29] >> Oh. I can't move that, but I can move my screen.
[288:32] >> Okay. There we go.
[288:34] >> Actually, I can. Give me a second.
[288:36] I got a new idea. New idea.
[288:39] This one. >> Oh, look at you.
[288:41] >> That will move it. >> Okay.
[288:45] So, what we're going to do is -- I only did one input. And it's ID2.
[288:52] >> Actually -- okay. If you remember, we actually did two.
[288:57] But remember the first one failed. But it must not have failed at the point of putting the data in there.
[289:03] It failed at the point of retrieving it. Do you remember why it failed?
[289:07] What we had wrong in there? >> Yeah.
[289:10] >> And it ran all the way through your functions. So, you did -- dude, I need more excitement.
[289:15] You did it. >> Okay.
[289:17] This makes sense. This makes sense.
[289:19] >> Yeah. >> Okay.
[289:21] I'm more excited now. But if I want to do -- I'll do a different Twitter handle.
[289:25] And we'll run it again. >> Let's go.
[289:30] >> Save. Yay!
[289:39] I was way more excited. Because I got it.
[289:42] Okay. So --
[289:44] >> You're a database star now. >> Ooh.
[289:48] Now I need to make the front end. I guess.
[289:54] I think. Okay.
[290:09] So, what idea did you have for the front end? Meaning how are you planning to put your Twitter handles and dates and stuff into your --
[290:25] >> For the moment, I'm actually going to pause. Because what I think -- okay.
[290:37] If I do this. Go to my favorite Miro board.
[290:45] Because I think what would be easier is -- I don't -- where is this logged in? Are you logged in on my phone?
[290:59] This is annoying. Trying to close everything on my phone and see if it fixes it.
[291:12] I don't know where I'm logged in on Miro. Other than right there.
[291:16] Nothing over there. Nothing over there.
[291:24] I don't know. It wants to fight me.
[291:27] It's fine. We'll just do this.
[291:30] It's fine. Just work around you.
[291:33] Maybe. Maybe we will.
[291:35] There we go. Oh.
[291:38] It's -- what? The hell?
[291:41] Unlock all? Like -- it's kind of creepy because it's me.
[291:51] Like it's a different me causing it to lock. Why?
[291:56] But -- >> Is it that Windows computer?
[292:00] Did you stay logged in on that Windows machine? >> I hope not.
[292:05] I hope not. But you never know.
[292:09] And the reason I'm doing this really quick is I think -- even though it doesn't want to give me that one.
[292:17] It's fine. Just copy and paste one of these.
[292:21] Is it will go -- I think.
[292:27] And then my SQL. This is my guess.
[292:35] So we've made it to step two. And then somehow work with Twitter API.
[292:42] And then it will auto post. And then I will find out something to do with the front end.
[292:53] Because I think that is where I probably spent too much time yesterday. Was thinking how people were going to input it.
[293:03] And that is really important. But I think it's not going to be as difficult as --
[293:15] getting my SQL and the information being pulled from the Twitter API. I think.
[293:25] >> Yeah. I think getting the API is going to be one of the trickier parts.
[293:30] >> Yeah. And my guess is at the very end with the front end,
[293:38] I'll probably have to figure out how to have it hosted somewhere. Which I would think that I can do it on my website.
[293:48] >> Yeah. Super easy.
[293:50] You can use your same domain or something. Or even just like a quick Vercel or a quick railway.
[293:55] Or whatever. >> Yeah.
[294:00] So I think this is good. I think this is a good pausing point.
[294:04] I don't know how I'm going to feel in like a few hours. Just walking away from it.
[294:09] Because I've been streaming for five hours. Oh, look at this, though.
[294:16] We only have a minute left for an hour. Dude, that is mind blowing.
[294:20] I don't know. Getting through each of these pieces with the time given without even
[294:29] meaning to. Bananas.
[294:32] So. Let me.
[294:36] Now I don't have music and I don't know what happens at the end. I've been so curious.
[294:42] Database. Theory.
[294:52] Worked. Yes.
[294:59] Push. Yes.
[295:06] Bananas. And.
[295:12] To make sure it's all here. Yes.
[295:20] Index. Database query worked.
[295:23] Yay. And hello, Balti.
[295:30] Even though we're going to leave soon. I will say I'm probably going to be back online later today.
[295:38] So. I just want to do like a full.
[295:42] Right up of like, you know, an article about it. Like be able to spend the rest of tomorrow doing.
[295:52] The video of it, like, you know, going through all this content, which. Five hours of content y'all just from today. Okay.
[295:59] We'll say three and a half. Three and a half.
[296:01] Hours of content from today. So.
[296:04] Yeah. And.
[296:07] That's it. I appreciate it.
[296:16] And I hope y'all have a wonderful day. Yes, please follow on Twitch.
[296:25] If you want to stay up to date with this. I also.
[296:28] Normally. Normally doing more fun.
[296:31] I find them. I don't know. I don't know.
[296:33] I feel like I have to justify coding live. So.
[296:38] I normally do teach gen tech, which is. On Monday, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Friday.
[296:44] And it is a. An hour and a half of somebody coming on the stream and teaching me
[296:55] how to do something. So Monday's we do Python. Every other Friday here. I think this week we start type scripts.
[297:01] And then I come up with random projects like this. And it's like, I don't know.
[297:04] I feel like it's a lot of fun. So yes.
[297:09] Thank you everyone for joining today. And I will see. I feel like I need to wait three minutes though.
[297:15] I know I'm like being really awkward about this, but yes, this is. Totally my first.
[297:20] The longest dream I've had. And I'm like, if I wait. Three minutes, it will hit the five.
[297:27] Don't know if like Twitch gives you anything for that, but. It feels cool on my side.
[297:32] Yeah. Thanks homie.
[297:39] Homie is doing all, all the links and stuff for me. I will say the website is something that I need to finish getting
[297:45] updated. I'll get there.
[297:47] It will happen at some points. But if you also want to know anything going on, it is.
[297:54] My. My Twitter is it.
[297:56] Twitter is my jam. It's my friend.
[297:59] Normally. Yeah.
[298:05] I'm going to get there though. We'll get this figured out. Thanks.
[298:10] Also have the podcast. You don't want to talk about where we talk about all the super hard
[298:16] topics. Then no one wants to talk about.
[298:18] Like. Homelessness or racial bias and all of that.
[298:25] Or gut health. Like we've talked about.
[298:27] We've talked about. I was oddly amused at that. Yes. At the same time, very grossed out.
[298:37] Like the microbiomes in your stomach. We also talk about death.
[298:46] Pride month. We talked about a lot of like different coming out stories. We talked about religion.
[298:50] I'm not going to talk about politics. Like religion, I feel like is a little different than politics,
[298:56] but I feel like it's a little different. So.
[299:00] Yeah, it's been super, super fun. It's. A journey.
[299:05] And yes, I am learning how to do. All the code.
[299:08] Two and. I love doing teach gen tech and the tech, because it helps me.
[299:16] Have more human connection by helping others connect to tech. Because it is a great industry and where, you know,
[299:24] I feel weird now because I wasn't prepared to randomly. Babble at all of you.
[299:31] But I appreciate you listening to my random babbles. And.
[299:37] Went through a lot. And yeah, there'll be a video and a blog.
[299:42] Of the walkthrough of all of this and the lessons learned. Probably on Tuesday.
[299:52] So I'm not going to talk about anything other than Python. I'm probably not going to do anything on Monday, except.
[300:01] Work on all the content. Once I get this all figured out. So thank you all again. We hit the five hour mark.
