[00:00] - Hello, hello, beautiful humans. Welcome to Teach Gen Tech.
[00:04] I'm Jen, your super ADHD, sparkly host, yay! And what is Teach Gen Tech?
[00:12] I stream anywhere from once to four times per week, that would be Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday,
[00:19] about an hour and a half learning about something that a guest wants to teach me.
[00:24] A lot of it has been Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, some APIs, some databases.
[00:31] We've had people on from like so many cool people, I just can't name them all.
[00:35] And join us on the journey, you know, join us live, be able to ask these questions,
[00:40] follow up by watching it on YouTube, hit us up on Twitch, on Twitter,
[00:45] on all the social medias. And yes, I move around too much, I stumble on my words,
[00:52] I have this ring light here all of the time because I can't see my screen without it.
[00:57] All of that to say, come join us, yay!
