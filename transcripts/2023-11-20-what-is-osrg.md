This is a transcript with timestamps of a technical conversation.

Write a one sentence summary of the transcript and a one paragraph summary.
  - The one sentence summary shouldn't exceed 180 characters (roughly 30 words).
  - The one paragraph summary should be approximately 600-1200 characters (roughly 100-200 words).

Create chapters based on the topics discussed throughout.
  - Include timestamps for when these chapters begin.
  - Chapters shouldn't be shorter than 1-2 minutes or longer than 5-6 minutes.
  - Write a one paragraph description for each chapter.
  - Note the very last timestamp and make sure the chapters extend to the end of the episode

Format the output like so:

    ```md
    One sentence summary which doesn't exceed 180 characters (or roughly 30 words).

[00:00] All of this is a big explanation to, what is OSRG? Oh, my God. All right.
[00:07] You're welcome. You're welcome for that really big buildup. So, all right. So, OSRG is a community that I started. It actually was kind of a spinoff
[00:28] from Kent C. Dodds' Discord server, where I saw some people doing some kind of crowdsourcing of working on open source projects together. And I was like, "Hey, I have an idea."
[00:42] So, I'm a huge fan. I've written articles in the past and done a lot of research on gamification, crowdsourcing, and stuff like that. And I'd heard about mob programming when I first started
[00:56] coding. And so, this whole community's core principles were basically, we were going to go using crowdsourcing of essentially a bunch of developers and our time and whatnot.
[01:14] We're going to go and find open source projects to raid, right? Because this is the gamified aspect, because we were going to start creating a game system, right? Think like how D&D has rules.
[01:32] We were going to create a game system that has rules, that has stats, and all kinds of other stuff. And we would basically mob program together massive problem domains that were very simple. So,
[01:51] a big problem domain that is very simple would be something like refactor all your tests from enzyme to react testing library. That was the big one that we were doing at the time.
[01:59] Or JavaScript to TypeScript was another one that we could do. And we'd find projects where it was maybe a handful of maintainers with a big popular project or even a medium-sized project that's
[02:15] still very popular or heavily used. And they're just drowning in issues, right? But they have like these big tech debts that need hurdles that they need to get through. One of our biggest ones
[02:30] is still to this day is a bit of like a magnus opus to this idea that it can work, it could work, it did work. And that is Hospital Run, where they had thousands of tests, hundreds of files.
[02:50] They had one maintainer assigned to convert it all to enzyme, update all the tests, and make sure that they're all passing. That one maintainer they projected was going to take, I don't know,
[03:03] like a year or so, maybe more. They were definitely drowning. And we came in, and at any given point, there was like five or 10 people live sharing like a VS Code instance
[03:19] while we're all coding in the same file or adjacent files. And we would just be kind of on a call like we are now, but it'd be like five to 10 people at a time. A total of 27,
[03:32] I think, contributors. And it took only 30 days to do the entire thing. Wow. That's actually really cool. I never knew that's how OSRG came about.
[03:44] Yeah, yeah. I used to talk about it a lot. The origins like over a year ago, but I stopped recently because it's still a learner community, which is what I wanted it to be. It's still a
[04:00] developer community, which I want it to be. But it's also evolved a bit into like a gaming community. And it could still be all those things, and eventually maybe what it was before. But
[04:17] no rush here. The community itself is, and as Jen knows, I'm very much like a huge fan of bringing people in and letting them kind of build out their communities. Actually, Theo
[04:35] was very interested in the concept as well early on and had like hung out in our Discord. But eventually he created his own company, Discord, and then eventually created his own personal
[04:53] Discord for streaming and stuff. But I'm perfectly okay being a launching pad community for other streamers and other people making really cool stuff. So at some point if Jen decides I'm going
[05:08] to go create my own Discord, I'm going to support that 100%. If Roy's like, I'm going to go create my own community somewhere, I'm going to support that 100%. I don't even stream on my own channel.
[05:20] It doesn't have to be streaming. Roy, for all I know, is going to end up creating the next breakthrough technology. I don't know. We never know. And so the best thing you can do for
[05:34] people in a community like that is just support each other. And that's really what it's there for.
