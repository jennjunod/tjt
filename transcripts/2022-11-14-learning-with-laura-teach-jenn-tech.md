[00:00] - Hello, hello, beautiful humans. Welcome back to Miscellaneous Mondays.
[00:08] That is a hard one to say. I really like it, Miscellaneous Mondays.
[00:12] - You know, I was thinking too, that as like a, as a subtitle for this stream,
[00:19] it could be shit you do want to talk about. - Ooh.
[00:23] - I'm digging it, I'm digging it. I need to put my, my computer on.
[00:32] Do not disturb for at least an hour. - Same.
[00:34] - Just because if I'm sharing my screen and you guys see pop-ups,
[00:38] I have no idea what will pop up. Normally, probably not inappropriate,
[00:43] but my friends will send me some random shit and I'm like, probably not something everybody wants.
[00:50] - I accidentally activated Siri and now she won't go away. Go away.
[00:54] And she says, I'm not sure I understand. Go away.
[01:00] - You got this, Siri, go away. - Go away.
[01:03] She's still hanging out there. Okay, sorry.
[01:08] - All good, all good. And as a total random thing,
[01:15] Twitch says that I have ads now and I'm like, okay.
[01:25] Like, I guess as a streamer, you can make money off the ads.
[01:29] So if it happens, y'all, if they're super annoying, I'll turn them off.
[01:35] If they're not that bad, let me know. Because if I can make money
[01:39] and you guys put up with a minute or two of ads, let's see if it could be a good symbiotic relationship.
[01:46] Yay, thank you, Ben. Ben resubscribed for another month.
[01:54] Yay. He's been my subscriber for four months now.
[01:59] Holy shit, the stream has been, Teach Chen Tech is four months old.
[02:04] - Wow. - This is kind of bananas.
[02:08] - Yeah. - Laura, when's the first time you came on the stream?
[02:14] - August. - August.
[02:16] That's crazy. I love it, I love it.
[02:22] Yay. Well, I,
[02:26] oh, for some reason, your hello didn't pop up, Ben, on, at least it didn't for me in StreamYard.
[02:36] Ben said hi too. Ben and Ben said hi.
[02:39] But homie and Bendy Meyer say hello. - Hello, everybody.
[02:47] - Hello. I'm still waking up, I'm not gonna lie.
[02:51] I am slightly struggle busting this Monday morning. I also tried gluten this weekend.
[02:59] I am seeing if I can eat more of it instead of being gluten-free
[03:07] because it's expensive to be gluten-free. I'm pretty sure I have hazy brain today,
[03:14] like foggy brain because of yesterday. That's what I'm going with.
[03:20] - Yeah. I'm working on being scientific
[03:22] and I'm taking notes every day to see how I feel, to see if there's a pattern, dun-dun-dun.
[03:27] But Laura, you have changed your Twitch around and have done some things and what have you been up to?
[03:35] - Yeah, so I spent some time on Canva this weekend and made a bunch of stuff and then I had to change it
[03:44] because I finally admitted to myself that, because my handle everywhere except Twitch
[03:51] was some variation of GoGoGadget, like Inspector Gadget. But there's an Inspector Gadget reboot on Netflix now,
[03:59] which is actually really good. And so since they're actually doing something
[04:05] with their intellectual property, I figured that if I ever wanted to monetize my channel,
[04:09] I shouldn't have a copyright infringement as my handle. And so I decided I will make it my actual name.
[04:16] And so I did that and then I had to redo all of my little graphics and stuff to reflect that change.
[04:23] So I've got some new stuff. Let's see, I could share my screen, I guess.
[04:33] - Which Inspector, oh, is it a TV show? - Yeah.
[04:39] - Oh, okay. I found it, I found it.
[04:41] And what up, Ramon? I am pasting it in here now 'cause, yeah.
[04:47] Thank you. Okay, and yes, please share your screen.
[04:59] - Okay, so let's see, with my Twitch, I guess. Oh, but it's gonna be all Inception-y
[05:05] 'cause we're on my Twitch right now. (laughs)
[05:08] Okay, not do that. - Can you share them in Canva?
[05:12] - Yeah, let me just pull that up. There are a bazillion of them in here.
[05:20] (sighs) And I had to, for StreamYard, StreamYard, well,
[05:29] YouTube has very specific requirements for thumbnails and shit.
[05:38] And so I had to spend some time resizing things in annoying ways.
[05:47] So maybe just this little bitty thing as what shows up on my Twitch behind the video banner thing.
[05:57] - I dig it. - And then the, like, so this is a thumbnail
[06:08] for a stream that I am doing tomorrow on my channel. Oh, and I gave my stream a name.
[06:15] It's Laura's Loquacious Livestream. Since I couldn't use Google Gadget anymore.
[06:22] Yeah, so I've got a guest on tomorrow talking about MicroPython.
[06:33] Yeah, so this is how I spent some of my time over the weekend.
[06:36] And it was incredibly frustrating. - Oh.
[06:41] - Working with the Canva tools. I got big mad multiple times, but I got there.
[06:47] - Okay, okay. - Yep, yep.
[06:51] And so you wanted to be today making a graphic for our streams.
[06:58] - Yes. - 'Cause we have streams, plural.
[07:01] - Yeah, we have multiple, multiple, y'all. And I, for anyone that has not seen us for a while,
[07:08] and what up, Bakari? We are doing miscellaneous Mondays.
[07:15] And then every other Friday, starting in December, because in the U.S. holidays are making things confusing,
[07:24] we are having Python every other Friday. So one Friday you'll have TypeScript,
[07:32] the next Friday you'll have Python. So all about language learning specifically on Fridays.
[07:38] - Yep. - Starting the Friday after Thanksgiving.
[07:41] Still, that being said, I figured we could all work together and come up with graphics for the two of us,
[07:50] because doing it by myself is not always that fun. - Yes.
[07:56] - So that's what I was going with so far. And let's see.
[08:02] And then if we still have time after that, because this is more fun and then we get a bullshit
[08:06] while we're doing it, and therefore I find that really entertaining,
[08:10] was also something I've been curious about. I've had one stream on this so far, is technical writing.
[08:19] And since that is your forte, I was like, let's, if we have time.
[08:25] I don't know how long it's gonna take us to make a graphic. Yeah.
[08:29] Let's see. We've got some questions in the chat.
[08:31] So I'm so sorry, Ramon, that Inspector Gadget is not available in Austria.
[08:38] I wonder if, since I'm in the States, I wonder if we could watch party it together
[08:46] and I could share Inspector Gadget with you, because it really is.
[08:51] It's a really nice reboot. I'm guessing, Jen,
[08:53] that you didn't see the original back in the day. - I have seen a lot of them.
[09:00] - Okay. Okay. - Yes.
[09:02] - Yeah. - Also, I just want to say this too of,
[09:06] yo, for Laura or I, we should like find somebody that would sponsor us for a VPN.
[09:14] And then you can watch things from wherever. Yes.
[09:25] - Yeah, yeah, yeah. And someone asked, where was it?
[09:30] I swear, somebody asked why I couldn't use the, did I make it up?
[09:38] Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Homie Ben asked why I wasn't able to use GoGoGadget.
[09:45] And that's because in the show Inspector Gadget, he's always saying, "GoGoGadget, this thing."
[09:53] Like, "GoGoGadget helicopter." And like a helicopter thing comes out of his hat
[09:56] or whatever, and he can fly away. And "GoGoGadget this and GoGoGadget that."
[09:59] And so it was, it's his catchphrase. And so that's why it is copyright infringement for me
[10:06] to be monetizing anyway, anything involving GoGoGadget, which is, it's kind of lame
[10:13] because I've been using that as my handle everywhere online for like 20 years,
[10:18] because like the Inspector Gadget franchise was like dead. It was very, very quiet.
[10:26] And then they did this reboot and it was like, oh, okay, well, it's a good thing the reboot is good
[10:30] because otherwise I'd be mad if I had to stop using my handle everywhere.
[10:34] And it wasn't good. Fortunately, it is good.
[10:37] And I can be like, okay. - That's interesting.
[10:41] They, especially with the handle stuff, because Laura mentioned that she got the,
[10:49] her handle updated on YouTube as well. And this is something that I've discussed
[10:55] with some of you of the handle situation I have with YouTube.
[11:00] It's not my friend. My personal channel has my name that everything else has.
[11:06] And I don't know, should I just move everything to that channel?
[11:11] 'Cause even though I changed it, it still is causing issues.
[11:17] So we will, that's a story for another day. I'm more excited about getting the graphic with Laura
[11:25] - Mm-hmm. - Can we call it go-go miscellaneous Mondays?
[11:30] - I don't know. I mean, I don't know whether people would get it
[11:39] or whether it would be like, if you don't say go-go gadget,
[11:42] then does, is it just like go-go like go-go girls? - Oh, and then people might also think go-lang.
[11:49] - Or like, yeah. There were like go-go boots a thousand years ago.
[11:54] Well, like, I don't know, 50? - I was posting job boards and it said,
[12:02] go-lang you must have like experience with go-lang, I guess.
[12:09] And I was like, I must be a no-go because I don't have go-lang experience.
[12:12] And I was cracking myself up and I put it, they didn't like my tweet.
[12:17] I was very sad because I was like. - It's so funny though.
[12:20] Come on. - Yes, I think you're accurate of,
[12:24] I don't think anybody's gonna know if we just call it go-go.
[12:28] - Ooh, good luck in your interview, Bakari. - Let's go.
[12:35] - Yay. - You got this.
[12:36] - Actually, so speaking of go, the language, have I shown you my wee gopher?
[12:44] - No. - Okay, so I'm a Python person, right?
[12:52] But I work at a go shop, so to speak. And so I've been learning go
[13:01] and I find go very frustrating to work with compared to Python.
[13:07] And so I bought myself the little go mascot because he's so, so, so cute.
[13:20] Oh, I can't 'cause it's so bright. Let me turn off my light.
[13:24] There it is. - He's so cute.
[13:27] - It's so, so cute and I can't be mad at it. So when I'm like, okay, go, why are you not Python?
[13:35] Because there's a way to not suck, so why do you suck? Which is ridiculous because I know technically
[13:48] why go works the way that it does and why it suits use cases better than Python does
[13:55] for reasons, but yeah. So then when I get annoyed, I just look at the little gopher
[14:02] and I can be like, okay, I'm not mad at go anymore. Let's go-
[14:07] - Zen moment. I dig it, I dig it.
[14:13] Okay, I am going to add this to the stream. This is my very, hey, look, it's actually learning Python.
[14:23] So this one was used for us at one point, but I got lazy and I don't want to upload them
[14:28] every single time. Different variations, today's variation,
[14:33] a previous variation. I don't need all of these now.
[14:38] I started episodes for us and I was like, I don't need all of those.
[14:44] So there we go. Again, old, old episodes.
[14:50] Oh, y'all, if you're ever curious how I find my pictures of the guests
[14:56] is I just go stalk them on the internet and this is what happened to Jay
[15:03] is I literally just stalked Jay everywhere until I found a picture of them that this was the winner
[15:10] and Jay will be on the show again tomorrow. We are going to be learning about VS Code.
[15:14] - Nice. - Yeah, I'm excited.
[15:17] Okay, but I'm coming to the end. This is also another variation.
[15:25] - Oh, that's funny, exciting. - Do it.
[15:31] Oh, y'all, can we give Homie a shout out right now? Because if you look at how cool this graphic is
[15:37] and this graphic and this graphic and then Bendy Myers, this is one for you later on
[15:45] when we need to reschedule. Homie made the last four I just showed you.
[15:52] - Cheers. - Homie has mad skill.
[15:58] So I just want to show this. But Ben, look, look how cool our graphic is going to be.
[16:03] Really excited about this. We need to reschedule.
[16:06] - Yes, it's so cool. So I love that Homie has made me want to do better
[16:15] because they're so cool. And so I'm kind of thinking like this one's cool
[16:23] and maybe we could repurpose it for ours. 'Cause for that episode, we ended up using this one.
[16:32] - Okay. - But now that I've seen your graphics,
[16:36] I am wondering what, how you're kind of feeling. Do you want that like teal pastel color still?
[16:45] Do we want to like, I don't know. - Well, we can try different styles in Canva, right?
[16:59] Like we can pull up. - Yes, we can try lots of different styles.
[17:16] And then also, do you have a, can you send me a copy of yours,
[17:25] of the thumbnail or something? So that way we can keep it on screen
[17:28] to compare with. And for those who haven't used Canva,
[17:37] Canva is like a simplified version of Photoshop. It's kind of like a website builder.
[17:46] Like you can make cool stuff. It does not do stuff as cool as like Figma or Photoshop.
[17:57] As a heads up. And for reference, there is the website.
[18:08] And we're all gonna hope that Bakari gets the job too. So we can learn even more about Canva.
[18:15] - Okay, I just sent you a link. - Sweet, thank you.
[18:21] - It's so cool. - All right, so many tabs, so many tabs.
[18:32] Here we go. So I'm gonna put this over here
[18:40] just so that way we can still see it. And then, and then we'll open today's.
[18:48] Yay. Just for reference, our two styles.
[18:58] I dig it 'cause we have Mondays for miscellaneous Mondays that we got to figure out and then Python.
[19:08] - Great. - So if for, I'm gonna cover half of some of this.
[19:13] So that way, because Canva based on the size, so if I go home really quick,
[19:19] Canva is super, super dope in the fact that you can, when you log in, you can create a design
[19:27] and it gives you, it will, if it's a common size, it will give you the measurements.
[19:33] So I basically make everything as a YouTube thumbnail. And then if I need a different size for it,
[19:40] I'll create it from there. But what we're using today is all on this
[19:48] YouTube thumbnail size. If I'm doing stuff for the podcast,
[19:53] I do need to make it Instagram size because Instagram is the size of the thumbnail
[20:01] for like Spotify or Apple podcasts. And then Instagram stories is the same size as TikTok.
[20:12] Random more knowledge for y'all. - The thing that bugged me was the YouTube,
[20:21] YouTube wants the thumbnail to be at least, I don't remember, 2000 some odd
[20:27] by 1000 some odd pixels, right? But then that's for the like,
[20:33] if you are looking at this on a television. - Oh yeah.
[20:38] - And then there's, if you're looking at it on a desktop, all you're seeing is like this middle strip.
[20:43] And if you're looking at it on mobile, you're seeing like a middle strip of the middle strip.
[20:47] - Yes. - And I'm like, so nobody is gonna be looking at this
[20:50] on the television. So what you're telling me is,
[20:53] you are requiring me to upload a gigantic file so that in the extremely unlikely circumstance
[21:00] that someone is looking at it on television, it still looks good.
[21:04] But for 99.99% of people, they're only ever gonna see the middle strip.
[21:09] Why? Why are you doing this to me?
[21:13] - And in case you guys are wondering, if we go into the banner image,
[21:20] whatever, we'll choose this one and open. This is what Laura is talking about,
[21:28] is basically viewable on TV, viewable on desktop, viewable on all devices.
[21:36] It is cookie. So that is why, cancel.
[21:40] Mine just says teach gen tech in different variations 'cause I moved it just to do teach gen tech.
[21:47] So this is a bit of a confusing area. It is a bit gray.
[21:52] It's a bit confusing. It's dumb as shit.
[21:56] - Yes. I'm just gonna go with that.
[21:59] I am too grumpy to say that it's confusing. - And another way that I like using Canva,
[22:07] and I think a lot of people don't think about, especially in the developer experience,
[22:15] is like here, you can upload them, you can add graphics and branding to your GitHub,
[22:21] to your, you know, just because we're talking about coding and things doesn't mean
[22:27] we can't make it look pretty. That's kind of how I go about it.
[22:30] And to me, seeing something like this, and a lot of us think of it subconsciously,
[22:36] is if we see something like this, we might be more interested in actually going through
[22:41] and looking at something than if it's just the text, and a lot of people think of this very subconsciously,
[22:49] so they don't realize that they're being drawn to something because it's aesthetically pleasing.
[22:57] - Yep. Or cute.
[22:59] - Or cute? - You know, yep.
[23:02] - All right, we have five notifications. Let's find out what it is.
[23:06] Oh, bunch of cool people have been posting cool shit. I like it.
[23:11] Let's go back here. So I like this one so far as one of them.
[23:18] We have all of these like templates, there we go, words, Jen, words, templates that we can choose from.
[23:28] And this is at least how I figured out the one that I currently use for the most part.
[23:34] It's actually at the top, this match victory. If you guys take a look at,
[23:41] match victory. - Neat.
[23:44] - Yeah, mine, match victory. They're the same.
[23:49] (laughing) Honestly, this is how I do a lot of Canva is
[23:55] instead of creating something on my own, I find a template and then customize it to what I like.
[24:00] - Sure. - Because a lot of them you can change colors
[24:04] and that kind of thing. - Yeah.
[24:06] - This one looks cool too. That one just looks cool, so I clicked it.
[24:11] Now, I just don't know if anybody else is gonna be able to see these.
[24:15] That's my only concern. - See what?
[24:18] - The templates like big enough. - Oh, it looks good on my end.
[24:23] - Okay, any templates you, oh, it moves. - I, this is where I get really, really distracted.
[24:42] - Did you just hear my dog? - Oh yeah.
[24:54] - She's scared of the bananas then. (laughing)
[24:58] - She looks really cute, y'all. Let's see if we can, oh, I love her little sweater.
[25:05] I love her little sweater. - Huh, Kiana, you're so cute.
[25:10] - She's like, no, mom, please leave me alone. I just wanna yell at you.
[25:16] Okay, well, on that note, yes, Bakari, I haven't been on a call with you in forever.
[25:24] Is your hair currently like this? 'Cause I haven't been on a call with you in forever.
[25:31] It is pretty cool hair. And I don't know, top 10 most expensive haircuts.
[25:37] I'm a little, little scared of this one because I would think that it would be a few gajillion
[25:45] dollars, but any of these templates looking, I don't want recently used, looking cool to any of you?
[25:55] (silence) - The how to become a freelancer one has nice colors.
[26:08] - Okay, I'm gonna, oh, I guess I could undo and then do this, I like it, I like it.
[26:19] - Do you have a palette? (silence)
[26:28] - I'm sort of. - Okay.
[26:31] - I would say I do have a palette and it's because I am attracted to apparently
[26:39] the same colors for the podcast and for the live stream. - I guess I meant specifically like in Canva.
[26:46] Do you have a Canva palette? - For the colors?
[26:52] - Uh-huh. - Yes.
[26:54] - Okay. - Well, for the podcast.
[26:57] - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. - And they just happen to be the same color palette
[27:01] that this is as well, at least for mine. So that's why I was like thinking, seeing what you may like
[27:10] because podcast or the show can change its color palette. Like Teach Gen Tech doesn't need to be the same
[27:17] as the podcast, it just happened to be because I like the same colors.
[27:21] - I wonder if you can share template, can I? 'Cause I've got a template going for mine.
[27:25] Can I like share it? - I believe so because I can like share one of these.
[27:34] I would just suggest you make a copy. But if you were to share the file with me,
[27:41] it would bring over and let me mess with the graphic itself. (hums)
[27:49] It looks like maybe, no, I don't think I can. - Does it have this option up here with the plus sign?
[28:07] - No, not on the palette itself. Well, there is, but it's add new,
[28:17] which is not what we're trying to do here. - Do you want the spotlight on you?
[28:29] Everybody will tell you how cute you are, but like what are you doing?
[28:34] - Okay, well, so I'm not exactly sure. There might be a better way to do this,
[28:42] but what I'm gonna do right now is I'm just gonna copy and paste the hex codes.
[28:46] - I dig it. - And you can create a palette on your end.
[28:51] - I dig it, okay. Oh, I apply for crossbeam.
[28:56] So I like, when I apply for jobs and I used to customize my cover letter and resume more,
[29:04] I would use their colors. - Mm.
[29:10] - It's a loquacious. - I'm sorry?
[29:23] Oh, L-O-Q-U-A-C-I-O-U-S. - Is Laura loquacious?
[29:38] Laura's loquacious live stream. [29:41], the hex codes do make it easier.
[29:46] the hex codes do make it easier. da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
[29:56] The hex codes do make it easier. - Mm-hmm.
[30:11] (indistinct) (indistinct)
[30:19] - Yay, all right. So when we go in here, not color, but if I go here,
[30:42] not color, but if I go here, colors, reload. (indistinct)
[31:01] Edit something, colors. Yay, it's there.
[31:07] - Mm-hmm. - Sweet.
[31:12] So, feel like, I'm still kind of stuck on the one that Homi made, like these ones,
[31:23] like updating it to your colors. - Yeah, or like a combination of our colors.
[31:30] - Yeah. Tweety bird image, please go.
[31:36] But, are there any other ones that you thought looked cool
[31:45] that we should try out too? - I just realized I should send you a link
[31:49] to my profile picture with the background removed. Would that be helpful?
[31:56] Or you already have that? - I already have that.
[31:58] And that actually brings up a good point. If you ever wanna have a background removed,
[32:03] also look at how many creepy ones. So if I have like this one that has my background,
[32:10] I can go to edit image, background remover. It's like the best thing ever created.
[32:18] - I discovered that, so this is actually one of the things
[32:22] that I was banging my head against, because I discovered that it's looking for faces.
[32:29] So the first picture that I tried the background remover on was the picture that is in my banner on,
[32:40] like Twitter and stuff. If you pull it up.
[32:47] - I'm gonna pull up Twitter, 'cause I don't know what I have pulled up on Twitter,
[32:51] and then I'll move it over. Please stand by.
[32:53] Hey, you changed your image. - Mm-hmm.
[33:09] Yeah, okay. So that is a picture of me when I was six.
[33:15] And apparently it was, it turns out that it was prophesying my future,
[33:24] staring at computers going like, what in the fuck am I looking at right now?
[33:29] And yeah, so it cut out everything but me, the background remover.
[33:38] And so then it was just like grainy picture of a child going.
[33:44] And so that was frustrating. And so I used,
[33:48] I tried using the manual one, and that worked a little bit better,
[33:55] but it was still a little bit, it wasn't super good.
[33:59] - Interesting. - So yes, the background remover works fabulously
[34:02] if what you want to do is remove the background and be left with a picture with just a human.
[34:11] I don't know how it works on more than one human. It works really well on one human.
[34:16] I have not tried it on a cat or whatever, but I do know that it will cut out
[34:23] everything that's not the, like at least a human or maybe cats and whatevers.
[34:34] - I also don't know how racist it is. These things tend to be racist.
[34:39] Yeah. - That brings up,
[34:44] I mean, it also matters on like the coloring too of the background.
[34:48] Because it kept all. - Pam, I'm trying to talk.
[34:58] - It kept all of this actually with the background remover on J's.
[35:06] I didn't add that in there. So, yeah, which I thought was.
[35:13] - I'm gonna kick you out of my room. You can't hang out in the office
[35:21] if you're gonna talk this much. - So if I, maybe restore, restore.
[35:31] No, here. It is still in my uploads.
[35:36] This is the original, bring to front, bring to front. So it actually.
[35:44] BRB y'all. (laughs)
[35:51] - That was fun. That was a lot of fun.
[36:17] - Yes, Kiona is 12. And, oh, Laura, can you sing?
[36:25] Because I feel like I should just like disappear again if you're gonna sing to us.
[36:29] - I didn't. - All right.
[36:35] - Oh, it was Bakari's idea, I see. I have to like work up to that.
[36:44] It's a thing I do, but it's like an anxiety thing.
[36:50] So I have to like build myself up to it. - Okay.
[36:56] Okay, let's build Laura up to doing this someday. Like we'll just start-
[37:01] - Yeah, definitely not today. - (indistinct)
[37:04] (laughs) - Kiona wanted to interrupt is.
[37:08] Oh. - Oh no.
[37:15] Breaking accessibility. - Hey, it is your face, Jay.
[37:18] We're talking about you, Jay. Actually, weirdly, we're talking about Canva, Jay.
[37:28] And we were talking about how Canva can be racist when it's removing background removers.
[37:34] And I actually used your image as an example because it kept all of your image.
[37:39] Like it kept all this cool stuff in the background. I didn't do that.
[37:42] Where on this one, it removed the background the way it was. So as we know, a lot of things that auto do things
[37:50] don't always see all skin colors. And that's what you walked into,
[37:54] but you also missed me getting frustrated at my dog and kicking her out of my office.
[38:01] We are, oh, okay. Well, that works.
[38:05] We are also working on creating our graphic. So, but even this one,
[38:14] if you guys want to see a funny photo. So this is a good before and after,
[38:18] but it will do a decent job because the colors are far enough apart.
[38:27] But this is where I don't always understand how Canva works because with this black background
[38:34] that I had on with black pants, it still removed it where like with Jay's, it didn't.
[38:40] So Canva, do better. That's all I got, do better.
[38:48] So if we go back down to Laura's or what we might have as Laura's.
[38:57] Laura does not have a favorite color. I asked because I was gonna ask about this,
[39:06] but we could do, and please let me know
[39:10] if you want me to do something else to these. I'm kind of just guessing as I'm going.
[39:13] - Sure. - Tweety tag, tweet, Twitter, change color.
[39:20] Thank you. I don't know how to spell miscellaneous.
[39:34] - You know, in the space that's available there, like the size of that space,
[39:37] I think that that abbreviation is probably the way to go anyway.
[39:42] And we need to change these. - Yes.
[39:59] - I keep wondering like, is this the last week that we're linking to Twitters?
[40:11] Or is it? - I don't know.
[40:16] To be honest, it's definitely something that I think it matters who you talk to.
[40:21] Because a lot of people are just doing it as a like, if everybody else leaves, they're leaving.
[40:31] Depends on how you spell your last name, but I couldn't see it.
[40:34] I don't know. Should we, I mean, maybe we still put Twitters
[40:41] and then that will redirect people to Mastodon. - Yeah, I don't know.
[40:48] It just like, because even like, social media philosophies aside,
[40:56] like it seems like the website itself might be in like, in trouble, like in down to the infrastructural
[41:04] sort of sense. And so it could be that even if everybody were like,
[41:08] yes, we're definitely staying, the website might be self-destructing anyway.
[41:15] - What do y'all think? I mean, we got a pretty good crew here
[41:19] of people hanging out with us. What do y'all think?
[41:22] Do we think Twitter's gonna shut down forever? - I hope not.
[41:28] - I finally figured it out. - I know, I know.
[41:31] I have a hope. I have a very strong hope
[41:34] that's probably not going to be realized, but here's my hope.
[41:37] My hope is that, that someone like Mackenzie Scott
[41:47] will buy it out of bankruptcy and gift it to the Library of Congress
[41:52] and the Library of Congress will maintain it in like a read-only state
[41:56] so that it's preserved for history and also so that the links still work.
[42:01] That's what I'm hoping. If it goes bankrupt,
[42:07] I'm hoping somebody like Mackenzie Scott will buy it and give it to the Library of Congress.
[42:12] - All right. - So much history has actually taken place on Twitter,
[42:18] like the Black Lives Matter movement. I mean, it obviously took place in real life,
[42:22] not on Twitter, but a lot of it was documented on Twitter
[42:26] and in Tehran, so many movements,
[42:32] all of these movements get documented where? On Twitter.
[42:35] And so we need to keep it, preserve it for history.
[42:39] - Yeah. And Bakari said mostly other countries.
[42:49] Homie talked about was there talk about it today, lots of things that is not in all places yet.
[43:02] And then Ramon talking about, is Arab Spring was the place that the Twitter,
[43:15] Twitter was able to help save people because they were able to use Twitter to communicate?
[43:21] - So Arab Spring was what, like 2010? And was, I mean, it happened actually all over the place.
[43:38] It wasn't a place. It was a whole bunch of places in the Middle East,
[43:42] but it was documented and maybe propelled by the ability to communicate
[43:49] through Twitter, like using hashtags or I'm not sure if it was specifically hashtags,
[43:55] but anyway, people were able to link information together in that way.
[44:01] I was actually not on Twitter at that time. And so I'm just sort of doing a bad job of summarizing that.
[44:09] - I posted the Wiki page, but to go to what Ben D was saying
[44:14] of they think linking to Twitter usernames is fine for the immediate moment,
[44:20] but that as a public people, we should plan as Twitter won't be here tomorrow,
[44:26] whatever that means for us individually. - That I have your names and numbers
[44:35] or discords or something. - I know and, and Mastodon, right?
[44:43] - Yeah, yeah, I'm, I'm working my way into liking Mastodon. I'm, I'm not there yet.
[44:49] - It's a process. - Not there yet, but.
[44:53] - And it's not like it's perfect. - No. - It's not perfect.
[44:58] - I think that is oddly something that I'm struggling with is it's also not as pretty,
[45:02] but that's, you know, it's, it's okay. - That also depends on which instance you're in.
[45:13] - True, and you were talking about that last week of how that really does matter on the instance.
[45:19] And if, - Geocities.
[45:27] We're all going to be showing our age here. - I want to go, I, I liked my space.
[45:42] - I hated my space. It was so loud.
[45:45] It was such an assault. - I loved my space.
[45:50] I loved my space. I made friends off of my space
[45:53] because of random shit I had on my space. They'd be like, hey.
[45:57] - I mean, I felt stress in my body just clicking on somebody's profile
[46:03] because it would be so, it was so loud. I mean, some people's profiles were like so loud,
[46:09] both like visually and in audio. And people would do that thing where they like hid the button
[46:15] so that you couldn't turn it off. And it was just so,
[46:19] I have, I have stress when I think about being on my space because it was just such a like sensory overload.
[46:26] - I get that. - Evanescence, oh my God.
[46:32] That was a while. - Mm-hmm.
[46:37] And you know what is like getting to me at the moment though is that I didn't know any of y'all then,
[46:48] but like we were all on say my space or like listening to Evanescence and so on.
[46:54] And so like, it's, it's like nice to sort of like retroactively go, go back and think about like how,
[47:02] oh, we didn't know each other, but we were still connected in these little ways.
[47:07] And then, you know, 15 years later we'd be buds. And it's, I don't know, I'm a dork.
[47:14] - It's true, it's true. I have a lot of internet friends now.
[47:19] And if it wasn't for Twitter, I wouldn't have them. And that makes me sad.
[47:25] Laura, you and I would not be friends if it wasn't for Twitter,
[47:29] because we met through Ramon. - And Ramon and I met through Twitter.
[47:35] - Uh-huh. And I have my job because I was featured
[47:41] on Vinny Kunj's Diversify Tech newsletter, which I only knew about because of Twitter.
[47:49] So, yeah. - This is something that is aggravating about Canva
[47:58] in case you guys wanted to know of like trying to just get pictures the same size.
[48:04] And then also you click on do on something and it'll just like bring back the entire background.
[48:11] And you're like, I didn't ask for that, but thanks. I realized I have to put teach you on tech somewhere.
[48:23] That's not what I want. I don't know where.
[48:28] Well. - There we go.
[48:32] - Let's see. Maybe, I mean, would it make sense to just have it
[48:40] be just putting miscellaneous Mondays and then our handles? 'Cause otherwise I feel like it's sort of confusing.
[48:48] Like which one of these is the name of the stream that this graphic is for?
[48:54] You know what I mean? - Yes.
[48:58] - Yeah. - I do.
[49:00] I use my link. I don't use my LinkedIn.
[49:06] I post stuff to it just to make sure I did it for what Ramon said.
[49:10] And then Homie just said, "I put one pic on top of the other one while resizing."
[49:18] Yes, yes. I do that a lot.
[49:22] I think where I get stuck on the resizing is the face size. 'Cause if they're on top of each other,
[49:30] you may not see like how the image itself may be aligned, but it may not be the right proportions for faces,
[49:40] which can look weird. And,
[49:44] but then how do we make people know that they could watch it on either one of them
[49:52] if we don't put our live stream things? I don't know.
[49:57] It's too hard. You know what?
[50:00] I'll bet other people have solved this problem. I'll bet that there are other people that have like,
[50:05] that have a co-stream and we don't have to reinvent the wheel.
[50:10] - Ramon, Ben. What do you guys, let's go stalk their Twitches.
[50:18] Twitch, Twitch, Twitch, Twitch. - So y'all, we are going to link to some dope humans
[50:29] here shortly and go get it. - Good luck.
[50:35] Good luck with curry. Yay.
[50:38] - Let's see. - He's squeezing thumbs.
[50:42] - I feel like this is the hard part is some, and clicks.
[50:52] (silence) - Yes, Bakari.
[50:58] So down. - Yeah, yeah.
[51:03] Ramon, you co-stream with Rizal all the time, right? How do y'all, how do y'all do the graphic thingy?
[51:14] - We just went inception on some antics. - Whoa, but y'all should go follow Ben.
[51:25] They're cool. And, hi, thanks Ramon.
[51:31] Oh, okay. Let me go find my discord.
[51:37] I'll go back to Canva. In the meantime, so many tabs, different tabs.
[51:48] I could stalk them on Twitter in the meantime. As I get older, in case this happens to anyone else,
[52:03] I say things that my grandparents and my mom say. Anyhow, anyhow, that is the most aggravating thing
[52:11] in the world. This is a cool one, too.
[52:20] It might actually drop in here. I don't, what did, John, what'd you just do with that?
[52:29] Please stand by, everyone. This is a really cool graphic
[52:34] and I need to share it with you. Ta-da!
[52:37] But y'all created a new graphic, too. I think maybe then the key is to have,
[52:52] if the more words you need to have, then the fewer other elements,
[53:00] like the cassette tape in the back. You know, it was cassette tape, wasn't it?
[53:05] Something like that. - Okay, we're gonna use this one for reference
[53:09] and look at all their beautiful faces. - Okay, okay, so we will.
[53:18] - Okay, so Ramon just said, "I, too, have Canva'd," and it triggered this memory of a Catholic joke.
[53:27] - Oh. - So there was a cardinal whose last name was actually Sin,
[53:36] and so the name was Cardinal Sin. And so this priest, you know,
[53:42] there's the, "Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned," right? - Mm-hmm.
[53:46] - And so a priest has actually fathered a child, and so he says, "Forgive me, Sin, for I have fathered."
[53:52] Allegedly, that actually happened. (laughs) - I know, let's do that.
[54:05] Let's go Gradient, Gradient Background. - Okay.
[54:11] - I don't know if I can change the colors. Can I change the colors?
[54:23] Will you let me change the colors? I don't think so, no.
[54:27] - Yeah, wait. - Only solid colors.
[54:30] This is also a fun thing of Canva is it doesn't always let you change things
[54:35] that are gradient. - Yeah.
[54:39] - And yeah, that's an edit image. How about Gradient Box?
[54:46] I don't care what your gradient. Oh, I mean elements.
[54:50] Gradient, gradient. - I feel like I hear a white noise machine.
[55:03] - Oh. - Do I?
[55:07] - No. Hold on.
[55:10] No, you just hear my machine. - Oh, gotcha.
[55:22] - And the fan's not cooling it down enough. I need to get a new computer.
[55:27] - Just a second. I have to go see if my house is on fire.
[55:34] I'll be right back. - Well, or maybe I won't.
[55:36] We'll see. (microwave beeping)
[55:41] - Well, oh, she's back. She's back.
[55:48] We're okay. - My mom's burning toast.
[55:51] - Oh, so that might have been the noise you started hearing me thinking it was my fan.
[55:57] - Don't think so. - Okay.
[56:00] Do you still, well, when you have sound again. - Someone's microwave trying to connect to the internet.
[56:09] I like it. I like it.
[56:10] - This house actually did burn down when I was seven, I guess.
[56:21] - Oh, wow. Okay.
[56:22] I was just gonna say, Laura, can we take photos like this? So this graphic is for a dance crew.
[56:33] And I'm like, I've always wanted to be a dance crew. I can't dance at all.
[56:37] But this is actually a really cool photo. I think.
[56:40] That's not actually what I was trying to do. I like Ramon's solution of no gradient,
[56:49] but you guys have something cool in this gradient and, but yours is solid.
[56:54] Okay, we'll have solid background. I will listen.
[56:57] - I don't know if you can hear my parents yelling at each other.
[57:03] (laughs) - Bye, Ben.
[57:08] See you later. - Bye, Ben.
[57:10] (crickets chirping) - Oh.
[57:16] Ooh. (hums)
[57:25] Hey. (hums)
[57:29] Oh, maybe I want that. Laura, I'm muting you for a second.
[57:41] (laughs) 'Cause I can still hear that thing.
[57:46] And I'm like, ah. So I'm gonna hope that this is going in a way you like
[57:54] in the meantime. Of, hold on.
[57:58] 'Cause I like how they did it with, they're all in circles and then they got the two streams.
[58:04] Okay, so we could be in circles. Photo.
[58:08] Circle, photo, frame. And we,
[58:17] eh? Nope, just kidding.
[58:21] 'Cause Canva has the ones that do let you just, like, keep the size.
[58:29] (hums) There we go.
[58:49] Look, it's Laura. Well, not back yet, but she's in her circle.
[58:55] And, ooh, we could do this. Put a sparkle around it.
[59:02] Oh. Well, that was, oh, hey.
[59:10] I don't know what y'all think. Group.
[59:16] What y'all think of this? She's in a sparkly frame.
[59:22] Like, make the frame slightly bigger. What the heck?
[59:29] It made Laura go away. There we go.
[59:46] Laura, look, you're, you were in a,
[59:50] why does it keep going away? - I'm all good now.
[59:53] - Okay, well, you're in a gold circle. - Woo!
[59:58] - We got that far. Do you like the gold, or is it too flashy?
[60:01] - Yeah, I like the gold. - Sweet.
[60:04] Okay. And duplicate, and see if my photo can go in.
[60:12] No, no, no, okay. Ungroup.
[60:17] No. Okay.
[60:20] There we go. Well, that kind of worked.
[60:32] I don't know why it keeps deleting the image. Well, I can't.
[60:45] Yeah, yeah, this is basically the problem of doing DevRel work.
[60:48] Trying to figure out graphics, trying to figure out how to livestream stuff.
[60:55] Okay, let's see. I think that works.
[61:02] I can't see well enough. No, no.
[61:06] And we will group them together. - Group.
[61:16] Oh! I wish you luck, sir.
[61:24] I wish you luck. - Startup life.
[61:26] - Okay, and. - Actually, speaking of startup life,
[61:32] I'm gonna have to go in about eight minutes. - I'll be working on our graphic.
[61:38] Don't worry about me. I'll just try to be.
[61:42] - Okay. - Other than, I like your font.
[61:51] - Which one? - This one.
[61:58] - It's called Computer Says No. - I like it.
[62:03] Okay. And Ramon, I really, really do not envy you
[62:10] about being the new videographer of the company now. It's not fun.
[62:17] Computer. Come back.
[62:27] No. (mouse clicking)
[62:33] Fisk Mondays. And we can make that smaller.
[62:51] (humming) - I feel like I'm trying my best
[63:01] not to just copy their format 100%. And it's not going really well right now, y'all.
[63:08] - You know, so something I do sometimes is I will just like directly copy to start off with.
[63:15] Like my first draft is just direct copy. And then, you know, iterating from there.
[63:24] But not trying to do both at the same time. Like not both trying to like get all of the elements
[63:29] in place and put my own spin on them. - That is smart.
[63:35] That is smart. All right.
[63:37] That means I need to put that back. I'm also staring at them thinking.
[63:56] Well, we can. Okay, well, I'm just gonna go with I'll work on this one.
[64:05] 'Cause we've already taken an hour of working through random stuff and.
[64:11] Homie said that's what Milli Vanilli used to do. Just never the second part.
[64:21] (laughing) I think this one's going above my head.
[64:26] - Who's Milli Vanilli? - I think they were a band in like the maybe early 90s.
[64:36] Something like that. And they got caught lip syncing, maybe it was.
[64:43] - Oh, hmm. - I kind of think real voice.
[64:52] Yeah, yeah, who's the real voice behind Milli Vanilli? Yeah, yeah, I think they were lip syncing
[64:59] and then they were like on stage and what they were lips, the track they were lip syncing to like went out.
[65:04] And so it became obvious and then they could not sing. And so it became obvious that they were not in fact
[65:09] doing their voices. I think is the way that that worked.
[65:15] I was alive, but it was very little. So I've only heard about it in.
[65:22] - Who is, I don't know who here is all about the podcasts, but there's podcasts that I got to find right now.
[65:50] Y'all, I'm like super concentrated on this, I know, but I guess I will work on finding this for us later.
[65:59] There's a podcast called "Not Past It" and it talked about how there was a woman
[66:08] who actually listened to her voice being stolen. Like people would, and she went through it multiple times.
[66:21] And, but it was before they said that lip syncing and that kind of stuff was not allowed.
[66:30] Or like that you couldn't steal other people's voices too. - Okay.
[66:37] - So interesting, interesting. Now I need to also find out why I missed
[66:46] all of these episodes that I'm looking on for my computer. Like there's a ton more episodes and I'm like,
[66:51] it told me you were done, that you had no more, but yay, there are more.
[66:57] Okay, well, I'll post about this on Twitter later on what this is and I'll tag you
[67:04] when I figure out what episode this is. But y'all, thanks for hanging out on a MISC Mondays
[67:11] 'cause next week we will probably have this figured out. Are we still doing next week?
[67:20] 'Cause it is Thanksgiving week. I mean, I'm still down, but.
[67:23] - I'm down. - Cool, cool.
[67:26] And then we'll, I have a stream on Tuesday and then we'll be taking the rest of the week off probably.
[67:31] - Cool. - At least for this stream.
[67:33] And I am gonna go see if there's somebody we can raid into so that way we get to know more new people
[67:43] 'cause I think that's always good. Do you ever raid?
[67:50] That's a weird question, Laura, but do you ever raid other ones?
[67:54] - I am doing my very first stream on my own channel tomorrow.
[67:59] However, I plan to raid, yes. - Ooh, okay, okay.
[68:05] All right, well, y'all are getting raided into Coding Garden and I've done that raid before.
[68:14] They seem pretty cool. I do need to make sure to go check them out.
[68:19] So goodbye, y'all, and have a lovely day. - Bye, thanks for joining us.
[68:24] - Bye.
