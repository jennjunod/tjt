[00:00] (upbeat music) Hello, beautiful humans.
[00:16] This is my first time using StreamYard, which is very exciting,
[00:21] as this is called Teach Gen Tech, Learning the Tech. I am starting this stream
[00:28] because as I've been working on finding more dev roles and going into that type of role,
[00:35] I realized I was like, cool, I have the personality, yay. I don't know any of the technology whatsoever.
[00:44] So I am meeting so many kind people that have been open to teaching me about the tech.
[00:51] And this happened at a previous role that I was in as learning services, where I would meet
[00:58] with all these individuals of the company to teach me about APIs, to teach me about the product
[01:04] and to learn the tech. And I was like, yo, wouldn't it be so cool
[01:08] if everyone got to learn with me? And a big portion of that is a lot of times
[01:15] I can understand when a super tech or a web developer, a programmer or something like that
[01:21] can describe these topics to me. And then I got to describe it to someone else.
[01:25] And I'm like, I don't wanna 100% fully understand this to be able to recap it.
[01:32] I also know that many, many of us that are in the newbie world are getting stuck
[01:40] and just need somebody to talk to, to get through this, to really understand it.
[01:45] For example, I started doing 100 Days of Code. Absolutely love the idea behind it.
[01:52] And I'm four days in and I'm getting so stuck on classes in JavaScript.
[01:58] It's like, that is such a simple thing. Why am I getting stuck on something so simple?
[02:04] Yet when I've asked one of the beautiful humans that are in this world, they're just like,
[02:10] oh, hey, this is how you break it down. Or this is how, you know, in other aspects,
[02:16] like how, what a documents do for an API and one piece of that was there was a person
[02:25] over at Stoplight when I worked there that were like, yeah, Stoplight does the API design first
[02:32] with the form first, and it creates the documents for you instead of having to hire someone
[02:37] that after the API was created, being able to go do all of the documentation.
[02:43] And I was like, I was with Stoplight almost eight months before I understood that.
[02:48] And I was like, yo, I wanna break this stuff down and have people along for the journey.
[02:54] Tomorrow is the actual first peer programming. And what peer programming is for those who don't know it
[03:03] is it's where you, there's two people programming together. One is teaching the other.
[03:08] So I will be making the mistakes live while somebody is teaching me how to do this.
[03:13] So we will learn together. And as always, please, please comment
[03:18] and let us know what questions you have because, and the no question is too dumb.
[03:24] I like to use the term, I'll bus truck myself, meaning that there's a term colloquialism
[03:32] that some might've heard of throwing someone else under the bus, showing up that it was their fault.
[03:41] And I'm like, I'll just bus truck myself because what that does is I'll ask the silly questions,
[03:46] the dumb questions, the questions that just feel like, you know, aren't clicking because I wanna learn.
[03:53] I wanna understand all of this. And I can only imagine how there has to be more people
[03:59] than me that are getting stuck on this entire world, especially with APIs,
[04:04] because that was a tricky one to say the least. I am excited to see you tomorrow.
[04:10] The first one is going to be at 2 p.m. Pacific and that is at 5 p.m. Eastern.
[04:18] And I look forward to seeing you all tomorrow. Bye.
